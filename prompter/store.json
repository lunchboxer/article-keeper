The title of the article is \"%ARTICLE_TITLE%\". It's your job to write the rest.\n\nTake it slow and review and, before you finish, edit the article to ensure that it has a fourth-grade reading level, about 900L, and the correct word count, 600 words. Be creative! Add some casual and kid-friendly language, but make sure to include lots of fun facts.\n\nAfter that, include a glossary for 2-5 of the most difficult key words in the article. Finally, after the article write six multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about the article. Don't include the answers with the questions. The questions should get progressively more difficult. Be careful to tailor your questions to the level of the student. The questions should be multiple choice with 4 answers given. Include an answer key at the very end.\n\nUse markdown formatting throughout. \"Glossary\", \"Reading Comprehension Questions\", and \"Answer Key\" should be second-level headings. Questions should be as a simple ordered list. There should be one blank line before and after each of the six questions. There must not be blank lines between the four answer choices. The glossary items should be as an unordered list without blank lines between the list items. Each glossary keyword should be in lowercase.","articleGenerationPromptB":"Now rewrite the same article, glossary, questions for a third grade reader.
