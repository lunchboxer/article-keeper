# Fabulous fabrics: The development of ancient textiles

Cloth and fabric are all around us - in our clothes, curtains, towels, and more. But cloth hasn't always been easy to make. Thousands of years ago, ancient people had to use what they could find in nature to make simple fabrics. Let's take an adventure through history to learn about how ancient fabrics like linen, wool, silk, and cotton were first created and used.

In warm climates near the Mediterranean Sea, one of the earliest fabrics was linen. Flax plants were grown and processed to make linen thread and fabric over 7,000 years ago! After harvesting flax, people pounded the tough stems until the fiber could be removed. This beginning step was called retting. Next, the fibers were combed and spun into long linen threads and woven on looms into linen cloth. Linen was lightweight and comfortable in hot weather.

Wool fabrics also have an ancient history. About 6,000 years ago, people in cooler climates began using the thick, fuzzy coats of sheep to spin wool yarn. After shearing and cleaning the sheep, the wool fiber was combed, spun into yarn, and woven into warm wool clothing that was great for cold weather. Wool was prized for keeping people cozy.

Another amazing ancient fabric is silk, first made in China over 4,000 years ago! Silkworm caterpillars were encouraged to spin cocoons. Then, the fine, soft silk threads were carefully unwound from the cocoons and woven into shimmery silk fabric. Chinese silk was traded along the Silk Road and soon desired around the world. Silk became a luxury fabric worn by royalty.

Cotton was also developed thousands of years ago, although it took longer to produce soft, spun threads. Cotton plants have been grown for over 7,000 years, but the seeds were difficult to remove. Around 3,000 years ago, cotton gins were invented to more easily separate seeds from cotton fibers. After ginning, the cleaned cotton was spun and woven into fabric. Cotton grew well in hot, humid climates and was comfortable to wear.

It's amazing that so long ago, without machines, these natural fabrics were created! Flax, wool, silk, and cotton shaped ancient cultures and trade. Linen, wool, silk, and cotton are still popular today. So the next time you get dressed, think about the ancient history wrapped up in the fabulous fabric you're wearing!
