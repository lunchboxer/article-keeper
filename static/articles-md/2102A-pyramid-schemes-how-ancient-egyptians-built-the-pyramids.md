# Pyramid schemes: How ancient Egyptians built the pyramids

Imagine standing at the base of one of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. These massive structures seem to touch the sky! The largest pyramid was built over 4,500 years ago for the pharaoh Khufu. It took 20 years and over 2 million stone blocks to build. How did ancient Egyptians construct these impressive monuments without modern machinery? Let's uncover the secrets of pyramid building.

First, the pharaoh hired a top architect to design the pyramid. It had to be perfectly proportioned with precise angles. Flawless construction was critical so the heavy stone blocks would support each other. Workers marked guidelines on the ground. Then they leveled the sand to create a huge square foundation.

Next, it was time to cut and transport stones from nearby quarries. Granite and limestone blocks weighed 2 to 15 tons each! Teams used copper chisels to cut large stones into smaller sizes. Levers and ropes helped roll blocks onto wooden sleds. Oxen dragged the heavy sleds to boats on the Nile River. From there, blocks sailed to the pyramid site.

On the build site, ramps helped workers drag stones into place. Teams used ropes, levers, and brute force to inch the blocks up ramps. Step by step, each stone block was precisely positioned. The first level of blocks formed the wide, square base. Then, blocks were layered inwards as the pyramid tapered upwards. Limestone casing stones on the outside gave a smooth finish.

A system of shafts, tunnels and chambers ran inside the pyramid. These provided access during construction. Later, they held the treasures and mummy of the pharaoh. The king's burial chamber lay deep inside the heart of the pyramid. Long corridors and traps protected it from tomb raiders.

After decades of backbreaking labor under the hot Egyptian sun, the last block was laid. The pyramid towered 480 feet over the desert, an engineering marvel. All that work for one pharaoh's giant tomb! While myths swirl about aliens or magic helping build the pyramids, the truth is that determination, skill and hard work is what allowed ancient Egyptians to construct these wonders.
