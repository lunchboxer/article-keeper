# Plumbing through the ages: From aqueducts to toilets

Hi kids! Have you ever wondered where water comes from in your home? People have been working on getting water and removing waste for a super long time! Let's learn about the history of plumbing, from old Roman aqueducts to the bathrooms we use today.

A very long time ago, around 312 BC, the ancient Romans needed a way to bring clean water into their city. They built huge structures called aqueducts to move water from mountains into Rome. Aqueducts were made of stone and concrete. They had tall arch shaped tunnels on top that brought water over long distances using gravity. At one time, Rome had over 200 miles of aqueducts!

After the Roman empire fell around 476 AD, new plumbing tools and ideas didn't really happen for a while. Most people got their water from wells, springs, or rivers nearby. Waste and sewage was dumped right into the streets - gross!

Things started to get better in 1596 when a man named John Harrington made the first flushing toilet. But flushing potties didn't get used in most homes until the 1800s. Before that, people went to the bathroom outside in smelly outhouses or used chamber pots.

In the early 1800s, new cast iron pipes and sinks and tubs started being made in factories. More people could add indoor sinks, tubs and toilets, which made homes cleaner and nicer smelling!

A man named Thomas Crapper made toilets that flush using gravity and suction - just like ours! He didn't invent the toilet though. He owned a plumbing company and made toilets work better.

As cities got bigger in the 1900s, they needed fancy systems to bring in clean water and remove waste. Workers built underground sewers to take away waste and storm water through pipes. Clean water was brought to cities through aqueducts and pumping systems.

Today, we can just turn on a faucet or flush a toilet easily. We have thousands of years of plumbing history to thank for that! Our modern water and sewer systems are engineering wonders that keep us healthy.

Pretty neat how plumbing has changed over time, right? From Roman aqueducts to today's underground sewers and water treatment plants, we've come a long way!
