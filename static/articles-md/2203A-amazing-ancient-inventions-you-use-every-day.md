# Amazing Ancient Inventions You Use Every Day

Get ready to travel way back in time! Believe it or not, people thousands of years ago came up with some pretty cool inventions that we still use today. They didn't have electricity or computers, but they sure knew how to solve problems and create handy tools using the resources around them. Let's check out some of these amazing ancient inventions that you use every single day!

## The Wheel

Wheels first started rolling around Mesopotamia (near modernday Iraq) around 3500 BC. Before the wheel, people had to drag and carry everything. Can you imagine lugging heavy jugs of water or large sacks of grain without anything to roll them on? Wheels made hauling heavy loads so much easier. Now we use wheels for cars, skateboards, wheelbarrows, and all kinds of other vehicles and gadgets. Life would be a lot tougher without wheels!

## Paper

The ancient Egyptians invented the first version of paper around 3000 BC using the stem of a plant called papyrus. We call this early paper "papyrus" too! Strips of the plant were soaked, pressed, and dried into thin sheets that could be written and drawn on. Papyrus was way easier to write on than the heavy clay tablets or carved stone that other cultures used. The Chinese later created an improved paper around 100 AD using bamboo, old rags, and other plant fibers. This kind of paper is much like the notebook paper we use today. Just imagine trying to do arts and crafts without paper!

## Alphabet

An alphabet is a set of letters that represent sounds. Before the alphabet was invented around 1700 BC by the ancient Phoenicians, people had to use complex systems of symbols and pictures to write. The Phoenician alphabet had 22 letters and made writing much simpler. The Greeks later modified the Phoenician alphabet by adding vowels. Almost every alphabet in the world, including English, is based on the Greek or Phoenician alphabets. Writing would be incredibly difficult without these ABCs!

## Sundial

Sundials have been used to tell time for thousands of years. The earliest sundials were found in Egypt around 1500 BC. They used the moving shadow cast by a stick or tall structure to mark the passage of hours in a day. Sundials worked great so long as the sun was shining. Later designs in Greece, Rome, and China were more complex and accurate. Sundials paved the way for the clocks and watches we use today. It would be hard to get to school on time without them!

## The Pulley

A pulley is a wheel with a groove that holds a rope or cable. Pulleys allow you to lift heavy objects using less force. The ancient Greeks first used pulleys around 500 BC to build their massive monuments and structures. The Roman Empire also used pulleys extensively in their construction projects. Today, pulleys are still incredibly useful tools. Rock climbers use them to traverse cliffs safely. Sailors use them to hoist sails and lift anchors. Construction workers and movers rely on pulleys to lift heavy beams and furniture. So do physical therapists to help patients lift weights during recovery. Pulleys make our lives so much easier!

Let's hear it for these clever ancient inventors! From simple tools like the wheel and pulley to complex writing systems, these ancient technologies pioneered some of our most useful everyday items. We owe a lot to the creative problem-solving skills of people thousands of years ago. Just imagine how tough life would be without paper to doodle on or wheels to ride around. What will future civilizations invent using our modern-day technologies? The possibilities are endless!
