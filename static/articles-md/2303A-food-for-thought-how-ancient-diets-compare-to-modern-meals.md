# Food for thought: How ancient diets compare to modern meals

What did ancient people eat? Was it different from what we eat today? You bet! Meals from long ago were very different from the foods we find in modern kitchens and cafeterias. Let's travel back in time to explore how eating has changed over the centuries.

People living during the Stone Age had no refrigerators or grocery stores! So Stone Age families had to hunt, fish, and gather plants to feed themselves. Their diet consisted of meat from animals like deer, fish they caught in rivers, nuts and seeds, fruits, vegetables, and eggs. Stone Age people did not have farms, so they moved from place to place following herds of animals and searching for food.

Cooking methods were simple. Meat and fish were roasted over fire or sun-dried. Grains like wheat were crushed and mixed with water to make a porridge or flatbread. Stone Age people did not use pots, pans, or utensils. Everything was eaten with their hands!

Moving ahead to Ancient Greece and Rome, people started farming and raising animals like chickens, goats, and cattle. This provided a steady supply of food. The wealthy citizens enjoyed a variety of meat, seafood, fruits, vegetables, eggs, dairy, nuts, olives, wheat for bread, barley, lentils, and wine. Poorer citizens relied on simpler meals of grains, veggies, olive oil and wine.

In the Middle Ages, most people rarely ate fresh meat. Only the rich could afford beef and pork. Peasants ate salted and smoked fish and used meat as a flavoring rather than the main meal component. Staple foods included dark bread, pottage (a thick stew), ale, roots, legumes, dairy, and eggs. Spices were treasured and used to add flavor.

Jumping to the 19th century, early American home cooking was humble but hearty. Settlers raised livestock and grew field crops like corn, potatoes, pumpkins, beans, and wheat. Common dishes were stews, soups, roasted and smoked meats, breads, and cornmeal porridge. As towns grew, grocery stores allowed more variety.Iceboxes kept food cold. Cast iron stoves improved cooking.

Today, grocery stores give us endless food choices! We enjoy cuisines from all around the world. Meals feature fresh fruits, veggies, grains and proteins. New cooking gadgets like microwaves and blenders make meal preparation a breeze. While our meals may look different, good food and family remain at the heart of every dinner table.

From hand-caught game to grabbing groceries off store shelves, meals have changed a lot over time! But one thing stays the same - sharing tasty food with family and friends will never go out of style.
