# Poor Richard's Almanack: Ben Franklin's Collaboration with Friends

What do you know about Benjamin Franklin? You probably know that he was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But do you know that he was also a writer and publisher? For many years, Ben Franklin published a popular almanac called *Poor Richard's Almanack*.

An almanac contains all kinds of useful information, like weather forecasts, recipes, poems, sayings, and more. Franklin's almanac became very successful. But he didn't write it all alone - he had help from his friends!

In 1732, Franklin began publishing *Poor Richard's Almanack* under the pretend name "Richard Saunders". It was full of witty sayings, funny stories, and useful advice. For example, it had sayings like "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."

Franklin asked his friends to contribute writing, poetry, math problems, and other content. His good friend Thomas Godfrey helped invent puzzles and games for the almanac. His friend Joseph Breintnall wrote humorous letters pretending to be a fictional character named "Busy Body".

Franklin also got help from his scholar friends. They calculated details like when the sun would rise and set, when the tides would change, and the dates of future eclipses. This information let farmers, sailors, and others plan their lives.

*Poor Richard's Almanack* was published every year for 25 years! It became the most popular almanac in the American colonies. Bookstores in Philadelphia sold over 10,000 copies each year. People loved Franklin's mix of useful facts and entertaining stories.

Franklin retired the *Poor Richard* name in 1758. But many of the sayings he invented lived on. Phrases like "haste makes waste" and "no pain, no gain" are still used today. And thanks to his collaboration with friends, Franklin created a uniquely American almanac that educated and delighted generations of readers.
