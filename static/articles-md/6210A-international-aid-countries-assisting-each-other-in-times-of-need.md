# International Aid - Countries assisting each other in times of need

Have you ever helped out a friend who needed something? Maybe a classmate forgot their lunch, and you shared part of yours with them. Countries help each other out too, especially when there is an emergency somewhere in the world. This is called international aid.

When natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes happen, many people can lose their homes and not have clean water or food. Diseases can spread easily too. Countries that are not affected or were not hit as badly by the disaster often send money, food, medicine, and workers to help the country in need recover. For example, in 2010 a huge earthquake hit the country of Haiti. Over 200,000 people died. Many countries like the United States, Canada, and Japan sent aid to Haiti after the earthquake. They sent food, water, doctors, and supplies to help the injured and rebuilt roads, homes and businesses.

Aid is also sent to countries that are very poor and do not have enough resources like food, clean water, hospitals, and schools for their citizens. For example, countries in Africa often receive aid from wealthier countries to help their people. India, Bangladesh and other countries in Asia also receive a lot of international aid. The money and resources helps improve education, healthcare, farming, and more for these countries.

Where does the aid come from? Most aid comes from developed countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, France and Great Britain. There are international organizations like the United Nations that also coordinate aid efforts. And average citizens also donate money to charities that direct funds to countries in need.

Sending aid can help save lives during emergencies. It can also help improve the overall health and quality of life for people living in developing countries. Which countries receive the most aid and how much they receive depends on how great the need is. The poorest countries typically receive the most international aid. Good leaders make sure the aid gets distributed fairly to help as many citizens as possible. Sadly, sometimes government leaders or groups take aid meant for the people, which causes aid not to help as much as it should. But the majority of aid does reach those in need, and millions benefit.

We all share one planet. Helping someone in need, even someone in another country, is the right thing to do. International aid reminds us that we are global citizens who look out for each other.
