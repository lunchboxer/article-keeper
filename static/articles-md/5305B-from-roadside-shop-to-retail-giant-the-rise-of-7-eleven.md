# From Roadside Shop to Retail Giant: The Rise of 7-Eleven

Let's learn about how the super cool 7-Eleven stores started out small but grew huge! Way back in 1927, a man named Joe C. Thompson opened a tiny shop in Dallas, Texas. This little store was first called Southland Ice Company. It sold only ice cream and fizzy sodas.

In 1946, the store started staying open from 7 in the morning until 11 at night. That's how it got the name 7-Eleven! More and more 7-Eleven shops began opening up all around Texas. People loved being able to get milk, bread and other needs at any time of day or night.

Soon 7-Eleven shops were spreading across the whole country. By 1963 there were over 1,000 stores! The next big growth happened in the 1980s and 90s. 7-Eleven worked to offer more yummy foods like hot dogs, sandwiches and Slurpees!

Today there are over 77,000 7-Eleven stores across the world in 17 countries! You can find them in the United States, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Sweden and more. No matter where you go, you'll see 7-Eleven's bright green, orange and red colors.

Part of 7-Eleven's success is adapting to local tastes. In Thailand, you can get spicy squid or sweet mango rice at 7-Eleven. Japanese stores serve up steamed buns and hot noodles. 7-Eleven studies what customers like and stocks foods people love.

7-Eleven uses new technology too. Their stores have payment apps, delivery options, and face scanners. But they still have classic treats like Big Gulps, Slurpees, candy bars and chips.

With over 60 billion visits every year, 7-Eleven remains one of the world's most popular and successful convenience stores. From roadside shop to huge retailer, the bright green signs now bring convenience, yummy food and happy memories to neighborhoods globally!
