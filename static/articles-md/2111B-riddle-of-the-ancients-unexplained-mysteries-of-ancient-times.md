# Riddle of the ancients: Unexplained mysteries of ancient times

Have you ever wondered about the mysteries left behind by people who lived long, long ago? Some of these mysteries have stumped archaeologists for a super long time! Let's look at some mysteries from way back that no one can figure out.

One famous mystery is Stonehenge in England. The huge rocks at Stonehenge stand straight up in a circle. Each rock is ginormous - more than 25 tons! No one knows for sure how prehistoric people moved these massive rocks and put them up. Some ideas say they used logs to roll the stones. Others think magic or aliens helped! We may never solve the puzzle of how Stonehenge got built.

The Pyramids of old Egypt are another legendary mystery. The Great Pyramid has over 2 million stone blocks. Each block is mega heavy - from 2 to 70 tons! How did ancient Egyptians build such giant pyramids without modern tools and machines? One guess is they used ramps and levers to lift the blocks into place. But no one knows for real. Figuring out the pyramid mystery has stumped experts for centuries.

Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean has another mystery too. Hundreds of gigantic stone statues stand on this far away island. The tallest statue is over 30 feet high and weighs more than 80 tons! How did the islanders move these colossal statues without wheels or machines? Lots of scholars think they slowly walked the statues across the island using ropes. That's pretty impressive for such a small group! But this idea isn't proven yet. So the Easter Island puzzle goes on.

Some ancient mysteries have to do with writing. The Voynich book is a medieval manuscript written in a language no one understands. The 250-page book has weird pictures and writing no one has cracked. Experts think it might be an old prank. But no one knows who wrote it or what it means! This makes it one of history's most confusing puzzles.

Other mysteries have to do with technology. The old Greek Antikythera mechanism is a complex, gear-driven gadget that tracked astronomy stuff. It was built between 150 and 100 BC, nearly 2,000 years before similar clock devices in medieval times! No one knows exactly what it was for or how such fancy tech could exist so long ago. This mystery still has experts debating today.

Our ancient past has lots of unsolved mysteries that keep fascinating us. While we may never decode all the puzzles, digging up clues and testing ideas is an adventure! There are still many awesome discoveries waiting in archaeology. Solving ancient mysteries helps us understand more about the history of humans.
