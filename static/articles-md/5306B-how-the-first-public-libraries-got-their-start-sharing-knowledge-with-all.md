# How the First Public Libraries Got Their Start: Sharing Knowledge with All

Let's take a fun trip to the past! We'll see how the first public libraries in America began.

In the early 1800s, America was a brand new country. Back then, books and newspapers cost a lot of money. Most people could not buy their own books. The only libraries were at colleges or owned by rich book lovers. Regular people did not get to read or learn much.

A few smart people saw this was a big issue. They knew that for the country to grow strong, all citizens needed to learn. These heroes started the first free public libraries to share knowledge with everyone in their towns.

One important leader was Benjamin Franklin. In 1731, he started the first lending library in America. It was in Philadelphia. Folks paid a small fee to borrow books from Franklin's library.

Later, in 1833, a man called Peterborough knew his New Hampshire town needed a library. He donated the land and some money to build it. He asked the whole community to help out too. It worked! This Peterborough Town Library was the first completely free public library. It let anyone borrow books for free. This became the model for many more public libraries to come.

Soon, states started passing laws so towns could use tax dollars to pay for public libraries. By the late 1800s, many towns across America had great free libraries. Having a library made towns proud.

Who were some of the first librarians? Back then, most librarians were men. Being a librarian was a good job for educated men. One famous early librarian was Charles Jewett. He ran the Boston Public Library starting in the 1850s.

Of course, times have changed. Now librarians can be men or women. But one thing is the same - libraries still provide free learning for all.

Libraries today offer way more than books. They have programs for learning, making, and playing. Visit your local library to see everything it has! Check out some fun books while you're there!
