# Dress for success: Fashions and clothing over time

The clothes that people wear have changed a whole lot over the years! Folks wore really different outfits long ago compared to what we put on today. Let's look at how fashions and styles have changed over time.

Way back in the old days of the Middle Ages, poor people usually wore plain tunics. Tunics were long shirt-like clothes made of wool or linen. Rich nobles dressed up in fancy velvet, silk, and fur to show off their wealth. Knights wore metal armor and kings and queens had on extravagant dresses and shiny jeweled crowns.

Around the 1400s and 1500s during the Renaissance, styles got more elegant. Rich women wore long gowns with big puffy sleeves. Men wore tights, puffy shorts, and tight jackets called doublets over their shirts. Bows, jewelry, feathers, and rich fabrics like satin were popular accessories.

In the 1700s, wigs were the coolest thing around! Fancy powered wigs showed you had money and status. Women wore tight corsets to pinch in their waists and huge dresses with wide hoop skirts underneath. Men wore knee-length pants, stockings, vests, and long coats with decorative buttons called frock coats.

Fashions got simpler in the 1800s. As more folks headed out West in America, tough denim pants called jeans got popular along with checkered shirts and boots. At the end of the century, women's skirts got gigantic with wire frames underneath to make them bell-shaped. Fancy hats with feathers and lace were essential for both men and women.

After World War I in the 1920s, loose comfy clothes came into fashion. Women wore looser dresses with shorter hemlines and more casual hairdos. Men wore wide-legged pants and more relaxed fitting suits. Hollywood movies spread these new fashions all over the world.

In the 1950s, poodle skirts, leather jackets, circle skirts and saddle shoes were hot items. Men wore shirts with collars, sweater vests, and narrow pants. The 1960s had miniskirts, go-go boots, hippies, and tie-dye clothes. The 1970s were all about bell bottoms, platform shoes, and wild prints.

Nowadays, people mix together elements from many different eras and cultures. Jeans, t-shirts, sneakers and hoodies are staples along with fun accessories like hats, jewelry, and fancy handbags. One thing's for sure - fashion keeps changing over time! What will be the most popular looks of the future? We'll have to wait and see!
