# Time travel: The history and science of clocks and calendars

Have you ever wondered how people kept track of time before clocks and calendars? Early humans used the sun, moon, and stars to tell time. As civilization advanced, devices were invented to measure time more precisely.

The earliest known clocks were sundials, first used in ancient Egypt around 1500 BC. A sundial uses the sun's position in the sky to tell time. Sundials worked well during the day, but were useless at night. Water clocks solved this problem by using dripping water to mark the passage of time. One of the most famous water clocks was built in ancient Greece in the 2nd century BC. This giant clock, known as the Tower of the Winds, not only told time but also included elaborate figures of the Greek gods.

In medieval Europe, clocks evolved to use gears and weights. One major breakthrough was the verge escapement, invented in the 14th century. This clever mechanism turned the gears of a clock at a regular pace. The oldest clock with a verge escapement still working is in Salisbury Cathedral in England, built in 1386.

Pendulum clocks arrived in 1656 and greatly improved timekeeping accuracy. Galileo Galilei first studied how a swinging pendulum keeps precise time. The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens used Galileo's discovery to build the first pendulum clock. He also invented the minute hand. Before this, most clocks just had an hour hand.

Today's most accurate clocks use quartz crystals. In 1927, physicists discovered that quartz crystals vibrate at a precise frequency when electricity is applied. This allowed the invention of quartz clocks in the 1920s and 1930s. Quartz clocks and watches keep time accurate to within 1 second per day, far better than early mechanical clocks.

Calendars have also evolved over centuries to organize society and mark the passage of time. One of the first was the Roman calendar created around 700 BC. It had just 10 months and 304 days, requiring periodic adding of extra days to keep aligned with the seasons. In 46 BC, Julius Caesar reformed the Roman calendar, creating the Julian calendar with a standard 12 months and 365 days.

However, the Julian calendar's math was still a bit off, causing dates to drift over the centuries. So in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar used worldwide today. This fixed the discrepancy by dropping 10 days and instituting a system of leap years. The Gregorian calendar keeps the seasons aligned by having 366 days in leap years occurring every 4 years.

Today, atomic clocks set the official time using the oscillations of atoms rather than quartz crystals or pendulums. The most accurate atomic clock in the world uses ytterbium atoms and is accurate to 1 second in 15 billion years - not bad compared to sundials and water clocks! Our modern timekeeping allows today's technology and travel networks to precisely coordinate activities across the globe.
