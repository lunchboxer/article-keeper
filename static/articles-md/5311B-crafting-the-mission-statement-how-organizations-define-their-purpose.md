# Crafting the Mission Statement: How Companies Tell People What They Do

When you walk into a McDonald's or see a Nike sneaker, you know what those companies are all about. But how do they let everyone know their goals? They create a mission statement!

A mission statement is a short sentence that tells what a company hopes to do. It's like their special motto.

Leaders at a company think really hard when they write a mission statement. What makes their company different? What does it want to be known for? The mission statement should get people excited about their work.

Let's look at some examples. Disney's mission is "to make people happy." Disney has stayed true to that mission ever since it started. From Mickey Mouse to Disney World, Disney tries to bring joy to families.

Southwest Airlines wants to have friendly service and low fares. So their mission talks about "warmth, friendliness, and company spirit." Employees try to follow that mission every day.

It's not easy to come up with a short mission statement! Leaders spend a lot of time thinking of the perfect words.

Here are some tips for writing a great mission statement:

- Keep it short, usually just 1-2 sentences. You want people to remember it.

- Ask employees for ideas. They know the company best.

- Talk about the company's dreams, not just day-to-day work. Dream big!

- Show what makes the company special. How is it different from others?

- Get people excited and proud. Employees should love the mission.

- Don't use boring phrases that could fit any company. Be one of a kind!

Next time you see a brand you love, think about their mission statement. It's amazing that companies can sum up their goals in just a few words! Short mission statements can have a big impact.
