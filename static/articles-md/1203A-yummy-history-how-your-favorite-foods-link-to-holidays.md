# Yummy History: How Your Favorite Foods Link to Holidays

Have you ever wondered why we eat certain foods on holidays? Many of the tasty treats we look forward to each year actually have interesting histories. Let's explore the yummy stories behind some of your favorite holiday foods!

## Turkey on Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving just wouldn't be the same without a big roasted turkey! The tradition of eating turkey dates back to the first Thanksgiving feast in 1621. The Pilgrims who sailed to America on the Mayflower and the Wampanoag Indians gathered to celebrate their first successful harvest. Historians think they ate turkey, along with venison, fish, lobster, clams, berries, fruit, pumpkin, and squash. Since turkeys were abundant in the area, they became the main dish for future feasts.

## Candy Canes on Christmas

Candy canes are a tasty treat many kids look forward to finding in their stockings on Christmas morning. But did you know candy canes may have religious roots? Some stories say a choirmaster in Germany made sugar sticks in the shape of shepherds' canes to keep children in his choir quiet during long church services. Others believe the shape is a "J" for Jesus. The red stripes were thought to represent Christ's blood.

## Hot Cross Buns on Good Friday

Have you tried these sweet, spiced buns decorated with icing crosses? They are traditionally eaten on Good Friday, the Friday before Easter Sunday. Hot cross buns date back to medieval times in England. Monks baked and distributed them to the poor on Good Friday. The cross on top represented the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Elizabeth I later banned hot cross buns except during Easter time.

## Mooncakes on Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival

The Mid-Autumn Festival is an important holiday in China that celebrates the fall harvest. Round mooncakes with sweet or savory fillings are customarily eaten while spending time with family under the bright harvest moon. Mooncakes symbolize family unity. The rich eggs and oil were thought to bring prosperity for the coming year. Sharing and eating mooncakes under the full moon brings good fortune according to legend.
