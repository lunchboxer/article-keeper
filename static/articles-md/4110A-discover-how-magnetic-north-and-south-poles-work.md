# Discover how magnetic north and south poles work

Have you ever used a compass? A compass has a red needle that points north. But did you know that compass needles don't actually point to the north pole? They point to something called magnetic north. Let's learn about the difference between magnetic poles and geographic poles.

The Earth acts like a giant magnet. It has a magnetic north pole and a magnetic south pole. These poles are near, but not exactly at, the geographic north and south poles. The magnetic poles are where the Earth's magnetic field is strongest.

Compasses work by lining up with the Earth's magnetic field. One end of the compass needle points to magnetic north, and the other points to magnetic south. This allows compasses to show which direction is north, even if you can't see the North Star or landmarks.

But magnetic north is not in the same place as true north, the northern axis of Earth's rotation. This is because the magnetic poles wander over time due to changes in the Earth's core. Right now, magnetic north is moving northwest across the Arctic Ocean over 40 miles per year!

In fact, throughout history the magnetic poles have actually flipped many times! Scientists think this happens because the iron in the Earth's outer core can shift around. When lots of iron lines up in a new way, it changes where the magnetic poles are located.

The flip between magnetic north and south taking place does not affect our lives too much. However, it does impact navigation. Airport runways are named based on their direction compared to magnetic north. So when magnetic north moves, their names need to be changed!

Scientists today use the Geographic North Pole as the official north for maps and navigation. The line between true north and south poles is called the Prime Meridian. It passes through Greenwich, England and is the line we use to set our longitude coordinates.

But magnetic north remains very important. It gives us an insight into the Earth's deep interior. And knowing how it moves allows us to keep navigational systems running properly. Pretty cool for an invisible force!

The relationship between magnetic poles and geographic poles gives us a whole new way to explore our planet. Next time you use a compass, think about the forces inside the Earth guiding that red needle around!

## Glossary

- **geographic poles** - The northernmost and southernmost points on Earth, where the axis of rotation meets the surface.
- **longitude** - Imaginary lines running north and south that indicate east and west position on the globe.
- **magnetic poles** - Where the Earth's magnetic field is strongest, near but not the same as the geographic poles.
- **Prime Meridian** - The line of longitude at 0° that passes through Greenwich, England and divides the globe into east/west hemispheres.
- **true north** - The direction to the Geographic North Pole, which differs from magnetic north.

## Reading Comprehension Questions

1. What is the difference between the geographic north pole and magnetic north pole?

   a. The geographic north pole is where Santa Claus lives.
   b. The geographic north pole is where penguins live.
   c. The geographic north pole is the northern axis of Earth's rotation. The magnetic north pole is where the Earth's magnetic field is strongest and may be hundreds of miles away from the geographic pole.
   d. There is no difference.

2. How does magnetic north move over time?

   a. It doesn't move.
   b. It moves east.
   c. It moves south.
   d. It moves and wanders, currently drifting northwest over 40 miles per year.

3. Why do magnetic poles sometimes flip completely?

   a. Because of solar flares.
   b. Because of shifts in the Earth's plates.
   c. Because of shifts in iron in the Earth's core.
   d. Because of gravitational pulls from other planets.

4. What is the Prime Meridian and what is it used for?

   a. It's the line that divides the Northern and Southern hemispheres and is used to set latitude coordinates.
