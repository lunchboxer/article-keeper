# From Roadside Shop to Retail Giant: The Rise of 7-Eleven

Get ready for a totally tasty tale about the journey of the awesome 7-Eleven stores! Back in 1927, a guy named Joe C. Thompson started a tiny shop in Dallas, Texas. This little store was first named the Southland Ice Company and sold only ice cream and sodas.

In 1946, the store started staying open from 7am to 11pm - and that's how it got the name 7-Eleven! Business was booming and new 7-Eleven shops began opening up all around Texas. Shoppers loved being able to grab milk, bread, and other necessities at any hour of the day or night.

Soon 7-Eleven shops were spreading across the country. By 1963 there were over 1000 stores! The next big growth spurt came in the 1980s and 90s. 7-Eleven worked on offering more fresh, tasty foods like hot dogs, sandwiches, and of course, Slurpees!

Today there are over 77,000 7-Eleven stores across the globe in 17 countries! You can find them in the United States, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Sweden and more. No matter where you go in the world, you'll see 7-Eleven's bright green, orange and red colors.

Part of what makes 7-Eleven so successful is that they adapt to local tastes. In Thailand, you can get spicy squid or mango sticky rice at 7-Eleven. Japanese stores serve up steamed buns with yummy fillings and hot noodles. The 7-Eleven team studies customer preferences and stocks each store with what shoppers in that neighborhood love.

7-Eleven is also a leader in new technology. Their stores have payment apps, delivery options, and even facial recognition software. Yet they still keep classic 7-Eleven treats like Big Gulps, Slurpees, and of course candy bars and chips.

With over 60 billion visits per year, 7-Eleven remains one of the world's most beloved and successful convenience stores. From roadside shop to retail giant, the bright-green signs now offer convenience, tasty bites, and fond memories to communities across the globe!
