# Doctors Without Borders - Brave medical workers helping in crisis zones

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a doctor helping people in need all around the world? That's what Doctors Without Borders does every day!

Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), is an organization that sends doctors and nurses to provide medical care to people in really tough situations. MSF goes to countries that are very poor or that have just experienced a natural disaster or war. They help people who otherwise wouldn't be able to get healthcare.

MSF was started in 1971 by a group of French doctors who thought all people have a right to medical care, even in emergency situations like wars. They decided to cross borders and provide care themselves! Today, MSF sends over 30,000 volunteers from all over the world to more than 70 countries each year.

So what does it take to be a MSF volunteer? First of all, you need to be a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional. MSF volunteers are also really flexible people who are ready to drop everything and go where they're needed most. Volunteers work long, hard hours in extreme conditions, like intense heat or bitter cold. The situations MSF works in can also be emotionally tough, so volunteers need to be strong-willed. Still, MSF volunteers say that helping people who really need it is extremely rewarding.

MSF projects around the world focus on different types of care. When wars break out, MSF sets up hospitals right on the front lines to care for people injured in the fighting. After natural disasters like earthquakes, MSF sends emergency medical supplies and doctors to provide urgent care. MSF also works long-term in countries with diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. They run clinics, distribute medications, and give vaccinations to vulnerable people.

MSF relies on donations so they can keep all their medical care 100% free. This allows MSF to treat anyone who needs help, even in places where people can't afford medical care. MSF's rules say they must help anyone, no matter who they are.

Some MSF projects are extra risky because they take place in active war zones. Sadly, some volunteers have been hurt or even killed while working. Still, thousands of new volunteers join MSF each year to continue their important work. After all, MSF's motto is “so that others may live.” For these heroic doctors and nurses without borders, saving lives makes the risk worth it.
