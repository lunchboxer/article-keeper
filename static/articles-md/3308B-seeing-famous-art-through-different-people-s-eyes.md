# Seeing Famous Art Through Different People's Eyes

Art is fun for almost everyone! But we all see it a little bit differently. When you walk through an art museum, what do you notice first? Some people see colors or shapes. Other people think about how the art makes them feel. There are no right or wrong ways to look at art!

Some super famous art has cool stories behind it. Knowing the stories can change how you see the art. Let's look at some examples!

The _Mona Lisa_ painting by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most famous in the world. The lady in the painting is Lisa Gherardini. She was the wife of a silk seller. Lisa's smile in the painting is mysterious. She seems like she's almost smiling, but not totally. This mystery makes the painting interesting to look at. Some experts think her smile looks different depending on where you stand. Neat!

The _Starry Night_ painting by Vincent Van Gogh shows a night sky swirling with energy. The stars look like spirals. The moon glows bright. When Van Gogh painted this, he was staying at a hospital for his mind. He saw so much beauty even when he was struggling. The strong feelings in the painting show what was going on in his mind. Knowing this can change how you see the bold, expressive brushstrokes.

Sculptures also look new when you know the story. _The Thinker_ statue was made by Auguste Rodin. It was part of a bigger work about a poem called Dante's _Inferno_. The man is Dante himself, thinking hard about the suffering of souls. Rodin used the posture of The Thinker to show Dante's deep thoughts.

Even simple artworks can have surprise stories. _Campbell's Soup Cans_ by Andy Warhol is what it sounds like - a painting of soup cans! Warhol was making a statement about buying stuff by turning this everyday thing into art. Knowing why Warhol chose the cans adds meaning to this famous work.

Next time you visit an art museum, think about the stories behind the art. Learn about the artists and what inspired them. You might see old paintings in a whole new way! Boring stuff can get interesting. Details that seemed small now seem big. Stories give new meaning to famous artworks. What will you notice next time you look at a masterpiece?
