# Wild and Wacky Sculptures Around the World

All around the world, artists create amazing sculptures that make us laugh or scratch our heads. Some of these sculptures look like regular objects made HUGE. Others look like fantasy creatures come to life. Sculptures like these grab our attention and spark our imagination.

One crazy sculpture is called **Kelpies**. Kelpies are mythical water horses from Celtic folklore. The name Kelpies came from the Scottish Gaelic word "cailpeach" meaning heifer or colt. In 2014, two giant Kelpie horse head sculptures were built in Falkirk, Scotland. These Kelpie sculptures stand 30 meters tall, which is almost 10 stories high! The Kelpies loom over a new canal and remind visitors of Scotlandâ€™s canals and working horses from the past. At night, lights make the Kelpies glow and seem alive. What a sight!

Another fantastic sculpture is called **The Spoonbridge and Cherry**. This unique sculpture was created by the artists Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. It is located in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden in Minnesota, USA. The sculpture looks like a giant spoon holding a giant cherry. The stainless steel spoon is 7 meters wide at the bowl. The cherry has a diameter of 2 meters. This larger-than-life fruit standing upright on a spoon makes a fun, surprising sight.

The sculpture called **Maman** by Louise Bourgeois is both beautiful and creepy. This bronze and marble spider sculpture has a body that is over 9 meters high and 10 meters wide. The shape of the body is inspired by a sac containing 26 marble eggs. Can you imagine coming upon a spider this enormous in real life? People probably don't feel scared though since the spider's legs are thin and graceful rather than thick or hairy. This spider balances delicately, reminding us of a protective mother.

**Man Hanging Out** is a famous sculpture in Prague, Czech Republic. This odd statue shows Sigmund Freud hanging by one hand several stories above the ground. The sculpture seems to defy gravity with Freud's body suspended in mid-air. Some say it symbolizes intellectualism and surrealism. What do you think? Creating a sense of wonder is what great public sculptures do best.

These are just a few examples of the wild, creative, and larger-than-life sculptures found worldwide. Public sculptures engage our imagination and bring art out of stuffy museums. Sculptures like these encourage us to look at the world in new ways. You never know what surprising sights you might discover if you keep your eyes open. What fun sculptures have you seen? Make it a game to spot delightfully weird and wacky art wherever you go!
