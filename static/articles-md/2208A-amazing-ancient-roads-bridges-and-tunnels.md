# Amazing Ancient Roads, Bridges and Tunnels

Long before cars and airplanes, people still needed ways to travel and transport goods. Some of the roads, bridges and tunnels built hundreds or even thousands of years ago are still around today! Here are some amazing ancient transportation routes that you can even visit.

## The Silk Road

The Silk Road was actually a network of trade routes connecting China to the Mediterranean Sea. It was used for over 1,500 years, from around 130 BCE to 1453 CE. Silk was a major trade item transported on the routes from China. The routes also passed through India, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Traders moved goods like spices, gems, glass, and more. Ideas, religions, languages, and even diseases spread along the Silk Road too. Remains of cities, palaces, temples, and walls built along the Silk Road still stand.

## Appian Way

The Appian Way is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads. It connected Rome to the port city of Brindisi in southeast Italy. The Appian Way was started in 312 BCE by Roman censor Appius Claudius Caecus. Parts of the road contain original material! It's about 350 miles long. Sections are preserved for visitors to walk on today. The road was wide enough for two carriages. It had a drainage system, curbs, and stepping stones for when it flooded. Milestones marked each Roman mile. There were also inns, temples, and tombs along the way.

## Pont du Gard Aqueduct

Aqueducts are bridges that carry water over long distances. The ancient Romans built aqueducts to transport water to cities and towns. The Pont du Gard aqueduct in France is one of the best-preserved Roman aqueducts. It was built around 19 BCE. The bridge part has three stacked levels with a total of 35 arches. It was part of a 30 mile system to carry water. It's made from stone blocks without any mortar or cement. The Pont du Gard is 160 ft high and has a channel that's over 3 ft wide. It looks like a bridge for cars, but it never carried anything but water!

## Anji Bridge

The Anji Bridge is the oldest open-spandrel stone arch bridge in the world. It was built during the Sui Dynasty in China around the year 605 CE. The bridge crosses the Xiaohe River. It has a span of 37.5 meters with 21 arches. The main arch is in the middle and is 9 meters wide. This design helps the bridge resist damage from flooding. Though it's over 1,400 years old, the Anji Bridge is still standing and in use today. 30,000 vehicles drive over it each day!

## Hezekiah's Tunnel

Around 700 BCE, King Hezekiah of Judah ordered a tunnel to be dug under the City of David in Jerusalem. It redirected water from the Gihon Spring to the Pool of Siloam inside the city walls. This kept the spring water protected during attacks. The tunnel through solid rock is 533 meters long. In some places, it's tall enough to walk through, but in others you have to bend over. The tunnel has an S-shape with carved niches for oil lamps. You can walk through Hezekiah's Tunnel today and even wade through the thigh-high water at the end.

## Gordion Tunnel

The ancient Phrygians were a group of people who lived in what's now central Turkey. In the 8th century BCE, they dug a tunnel under a mountain near the capital city of Gordion. It was probably meant as a water channel for irrigation. The tunnel is about 330 meters long with a height of 1.7 to 2.5 meters. It has a slight V-shape made by digging from both ends. There are 82 inscriptions inside featuring early Phrygian writing as well as depictions of animals and plants. The Gordion Tunnel shows amazing ancient engineering skills.

From paved roads in Rome to irrigation tunnels in Turkey, people long ago built incredible structures to solve transportation problems. Many are still marvels of engineering today. Next time you cross a bridge or hop on the highway, think about how we still rely on the ideas of those innovative ancient builders!
