# Lightning: A natural electric phenomenon

Hey kids, want to learn some *shocking* facts about lightning? Get ready for a *electrifying* article about this amazing natural phenomenon!

Imagine you're outside on a hot summer day. The air feels heavy, and dark clouds are gathering overhead. Suddenly—BAM! A bright, jagged flash lights up the sky, followed by a loud crack of thunder. That's lightning!

Lightning is a huge spark of electricity that happens during thunderstorms. These giant electric discharges can reach over 5 miles long, and get as hot as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit—that's 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun!

When a storm cloud builds up lots of electrical charge, parts of the cloud get positive and parts get negative. When the attraction between the positive and negative charges gets strong enough—ZAP! Lightning is the huge surge of electricity that jumps between the opposite charges within the cloud, or between the cloud and the ground.

Some lightning happens totally inside clouds and can't be seen. But when the lightning flash touches down to the ground, it makes a bright flash we can see streaking through the sky. The rumbling sound of thunder happens because lightning causes the air to expand quickly and push out a giant shock wave of sound.

Lightning strikes the earth over 8 million times every day! It's extremely dangerous because of all that electrical energy. If a bolt of lightning hits you or something near you, the huge jolt of electricity can burn skin, cause cardiac arrest, and even lead to death. Stay inside when thunderstorms are close by to avoid getting struck!

Here are some more electrifying lightning facts:

- Lightning can heat the air around it to 50,000°F, which is hotter than the surface of the sun!

- The longest lightning bolt ever recorded stretched 199 miles across Oklahoma in 2018.

- Rubber shoes and tires can help protect you from lightning because rubber does not conduct electricity well.

- Lightning strikes 6,000 times every minute worldwide. That's over 3.5 billion lightning strikes a year!

- Benjamin Franklin proved that lightning is a form of electricity in his famous kite experiment in 1752.

Pretty shocking stuff, right? Next time there's a thunderstorm brewing, listen for the thunder and look for lightning flashes streaking across the horizon. Just be sure to watch the spectacular show of nature's electricity safely from indoors!
