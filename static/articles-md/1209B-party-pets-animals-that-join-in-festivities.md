# Party Pets: Animals that Join in Festivities

Hey kids! Do you like celebrating birthdays and holidays? I bet your pet likes to party too! Let's learn about some animals that love to have fun when there's a celebration going on.

Parrots are colorful birds that dance when there's music playing. They bob their heads up and down and flap their wings like they're at a dance party! Some parrots even learn dance moves from their owners.

Dogs get very excited during parties. They run and jump because all the happy energy makes them want to play! Dogs love wearing funny hats and getting yummy treats from guests at birthday parties.

Cats also enjoy celebrations sometimes. They explore new smells and hide under chairs to playfully bat at people's legs. After the party, cats are happy to lick up any spilled ice cream or cake that's on the floor!

Farm animals join the party too. Goats nibble on clothes and steal food off tables. Chickens walk around hoping for dropped scraps to eat. Pigs run around loudly with party hats on. They love the fun!

The next time you have a birthday party or celebration, think about letting your pets participate. They'll bring lots of silly energy and make your party even more fun! Just be ready to clean up messes afterwards!
