# The shocking history of static electricity discoveries

Have you ever rubbed a balloon on your hair and made it stick up? Or zapped your friend with a tiny lightning bolt when you touched them after sliding on the playground? That's static electricity!

Static electricity happens when tiny bits called electrons move around between things. Electrons have a negative charge. When you rub two things together, the electrons can jump from one thing to the other. One thing ends up with extra negative electrons. The other thing loses its electrons and gets a positive charge. Opposites attract, so the negative balloon sticks to your positive hair! But when you touch your friend, the electrons zap back to balance out again.

A long time ago, people noticed sparks and zaps from rubbing objects together. Around 600 BC, a Greek scientist named Thales wrote about seeing sparks when he rubbed amber. Amber is an old, yellowish stone that comes from tree sap. Thales called this effect “electra”, the Greek word for amber. That's where we get the name electricity!

For hundreds of years, scientists played with static sparks but didn't really get what caused them. One important scientist was William Gilbert from England. In 1600 he wrote a book describing experiments with magnets and static charges. He called this effect “electric force” and realized objects could have electric charges.

The next breakthrough came from Stephen Gray. In 1729, he showed that electricity can flow through metal wires. Gray even sent charges over 607 feet using a wet string as a wire! This proved electricity was different than magnetism.

You've probably heard of Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment. During a thunderstorm in 1752, he flew a kite with a metal key to show that lightning was electrical. But Franklin did lots of other experiments with static electricity too. He rubbed glass, wax, and other things to create static sparks. Franklin came up with terms like “negative charge”, “positive charge” and “battery”.

In the 1800s, more scientists like Alessandro Volta, Michael Faraday and Georg Ohm built on Franklin's work. Volta invented early batteries that produced steady electricity for experiments. Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction - how magnets can make electricity. Ohm figured out the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. Their discoveries made it possible to use electricity for technology.

So what causes that balloon to stick to your hair? In the 1900s, scientists finally solved the mystery. Some materials hang onto their electrons tightly. Other materials let electrons jump away. Rubbing the materials knocks electrons free and they stick to the other surface. This makes positive and negative static charges. Now we know exactly why your hair stands up when you rub that balloon!

Next time you get a shock from static, think about how it stumped scientists for so long! The sparky effects that seem like magic today were a huge mystery not that long ago. With clever experiments, physicists slowly uncovered the secrets of static and invented our modern electricity. Now we have lights and technology that run on static charges!
