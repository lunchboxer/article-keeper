# Speaking Out - Using your voice against injustice

Have you ever seen something unfair happen at school and wanted to speak up about it? Speaking out against unfair things takes bravery. But it’s a good way to make positive change happen. All through history, people have used their voices to stand up for what’s right.

Let’s look at some examples from the past. In 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested. Why? She refused to give up her bus seat to a white person in Alabama. Back then, black people had to sit in the back of the bus. Rosa didn’t think that rule was fair. Her brave act started the Montgomery Bus Boycott. That helped launch the civil rights movement in America. People refused to ride the buses for over a year. Finally, the Supreme Court said bus segregation was unconstitutional. Rosa showed that one person can make a big difference by speaking out against unjust rules.

Even kids can stand up for what they believe in. In 1960, six-year-old Ruby Bridges did something important. She was the first black student to go to an all-white elementary school in New Orleans. Every day, federal marshals walked with her past angry crowds of people shouting at her. But Ruby faced their anger with quiet courage. She helped schools in the South become integrated, so black and white students could learn together. Ruby’s bravery inspired many people.

You can raise your voice too! Here are some ways how:

- Write a letter or petition. Get others to sign it. Send it to your principal to show that students want change.

- Organize a rally at recess. Make signs about your cause. Perform chants to get attention.

- Give a speech at a school meeting. Explain your views to the leaders who make decisions.

- Post on social media. Share fun graphics and use hashtags about your issue. That spreads awareness.

- Wear shirts or buttons with protest messages. Even small things like armbands can share what you believe in.

Speaking out against unfairness is not always easy. Some people may disagree and criticize you. But staying quiet means unfair things will keep happening. Find your voice and let it be heard. The future is shaped by those brave enough to stand up for what's right!
