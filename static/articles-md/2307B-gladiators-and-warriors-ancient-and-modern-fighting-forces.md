# Gladiators and warriors: Ancient and modern fighting forces

All around the world, warriors and gladiators have battled for thousands of years. They used different weapons and wore special armor and outfits for fighting. Even though they lived long ago, they were very skilled and brave fighters. Letâ€™s explore some cool warriors and gladiators from the past and today!

In Ancient Rome, gladiators were like sports superstars who fought in front of crowds of fans. Some gladiators chose to fight for money and fame. Others were forced into it and had no choice. Gladiators trained really hard at special schools. They built up their muscles and learned to use swords, spears, nets, and shields.

When it was time to battle, gladiators marched into giant outdoor arenas. The arenas were called amphitheaters. The biggest one was the Roman Colosseum. It held up to 50,000 people in the crowd to watch! There were strict rules during the fights. Referees made sure the gladiators didn't break the rules. Many matches ended when one gladiator surrendered or was hurt too badly to keep going. The referee would ask the crowd if the losing gladiator should live or die. The crowd yelled "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" to decide.

Now let's move to medieval times in Europe. Knights were warriors who rode horses and wore full metal armor into battle. Being a knight cost a lot of money. Their armor could weigh over 100 pounds! Knights had to train since childhood. They practiced horseback riding, sword fighting, spear throwing, and living by a code of chivalry.

Chivalry meant knights should be honorable, brave, and treat people right. There were medieval rules for how knights should act. Knights took vows at ceremonies to follow this code. If they broke the rules, they lost their knight status.

Knights charged into battle on horses called destriers. When two groups of armored knights rammed into each other, it was really loud and violent! Lances and swords would break. Helmets would get smashed. Knights got knocked off their horses. Battles could go on for hours until one side finally surrendered.

Now let's check out a modern warrior group. Navy SEALs are American special forces soldiers who go on secret and dangerous military missions on sea, air, and land. SEAL training pushes recruits to their limits. They have to run miles in heavy gear, swim far distances, survive in the wilderness, and more - with little food or sleep!

Navy SEALs' identities and missions are top secret. But we do know they use high tech weapons and gear on their missions. SEALs carry out raids, rescue hostages, gather military information, and other important duties all over the world. Their motto is "the only easy day was yesterday." This reminds them to expect tough challenges every day.

From ancient gladiators to medieval knights to today's Navy SEALs, generations of warriors have shown unbelievable skill and bravery. Their lives were very different from ours. But we can still be impressed by their dedication and courage!
