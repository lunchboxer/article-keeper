# Wild and Wacky Sculptures Around the World

All around the world, artists make really neat sculptures. Some look like regular stuff but really big. Others look like pretend creatures come to life! Sculptures like these get our attention. They make us laugh and think.

One crazy sculpture is the **Kelpies**. Kelpies were water horses in Celtic old tales. The name Kelpies came from a Scottish word meaning colt. In 2014, two huge fake Kelpie heads were built in Scotland. They stand 10 stories high! That's taller than a building. The fake Kelpies watch over a canal. At night, lights make the Kelpies glow. Seeing them is a surprise!

Another fun sculpture is called **Spoonbridge and Cherry**. It was made by artists Claes and Coosje. This sculpture is in Minneapolis in the USA. It looks just like a giant spoon holding a giant cherry! The metal spoon is 7 meters wide. That's wider than a school bus! The big pretend cherry is 2 meters around. Who knew fruit could stand on a spoon? This silly sight makes people laugh.

The sculpture named **Maman** by Louise Bourgeois is pretty and creepy. This bronze and marble spider is over 9 meters high. That's as tall as two houses! Its body looks like a sac with 26 marble eggs inside. Picture coming upon a spider this big for real! People probably aren't scared though. The legs are thin, not thick. This nice mama spider is careful and graceful.

**Man Hanging Out** is a famous statue in Prague. It shows Sigmund Freud hanging in mid-air high above the ground. How does he hang there? The crazy statue makes us wonder. Some say it shows ideas and surprise. That's what great statues do!
