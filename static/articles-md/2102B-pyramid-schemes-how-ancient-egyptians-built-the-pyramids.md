# Pyramid schemes: How ancient Egyptians built the pyramids

The ancient Egyptians built some of the biggest buildings in the world! The pyramids they made are super huge. The biggest pyramid is called the Great Pyramid. It was built for Pharaoh Khufu over 4,500 years ago! This pyramid is almost 500 feet tall. That's taller than a 40 story building!

It took around 20 years for ancient Egyptians to build the Great Pyramid. More than 2 million heavy blocks were used. The blocks were made of stone like limestone and granite. How did they build such big pyramids without cranes or bulldozers? Let's find out!

First, Khufu hired a very smart architect. The architect designed the pyramid to be perfect. The stone blocks had to fit together just right. Workers marked lines in the sand to show where each block should go. They flattened the sand to make the foundation.

Next, workers cut big blocks into smaller sizes at quarries. Quarries are places where stones are dug up. Teams used ropes and levers to move blocks. They put blocks on sleds pulled by oxen to the pyramid.

At the pyramid, ramps helped drag blocks into place. Using ropes, levers and muscle, they pushed blocks up ramps. Carefully, each stone was put where it belonged. Soon the wide base was done. Then inward layers tapered up into a point. Smooth casing stones were put on the outside.  

Inside were shafts, tunnels and rooms. These let workers get around while building. Later they held treasures and the mummy of the pharaoh. The burial room was deep inside where no one could get to it. Building the pyramid was very hard work! But after many years, it was finally done.

This huge tomb was built just for one pharaoh! Myths say aliens or magic helped build the pyramids. But it was really skilled workers and determination that let ancient Egyptians make these amazing structures.
