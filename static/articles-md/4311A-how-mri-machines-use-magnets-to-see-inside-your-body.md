# How MRI Machines Use Magnets to See Inside Your Body

Have you ever had an MRI scan at the hospital? MRI stands for magnetic resonance imaging. An MRI machine uses powerful magnets to take clear pictures of the inside of your body. It can see your bones, muscles, organs, and more!

The MRI machine is shaped like a big donut. You lie down on a movable bed and get slid into the donut hole. The MRI technician then moves the bed into the center of the machine. This is where the magic happens!

Inside the machine are some of the strongest magnets in the world. When you are inside, these magnets make the atoms in your body line up in the same direction. The MRI machine also gives off radio waves that knock the atoms out of line again. As the atoms realign, they give off energy. This energy is picked up by the MRI scanner. A computer takes this energy information and turns it into a detailed picture.

Since different tissues in the body give off different energy signals, the MRI can tell if something is muscle, bone, blood vessels, or something else. That's how doctors can see if specific parts of your body are healthy or injured. Pretty cool, huh?

Some MRI machines are open on both ends. This can help patients feel less nervous about being in an enclosed space. However, the open design means the machine has to be bigger and more powerful to take pictures.

During the scan, the machine is very noisy. You have to wear earplugs or headphones to protect your hearing. The cool magnets also mean no metal can be near the machine. If you have metal implants or fillings, they could get pulled out! Even paperclips or credit cards have to be left outside the room.

Many patients get nervous about lying still inside the tight space of an MRI tube. Fortunately, once you are settled on the bed, it slowly slides to move you into place. This gradual motion can help anxious people stay calm.

The radiology technician will tell you when the scan starts. You'll hear loud clanging noises around you as the machine takes pictures. The technician can see and talk to you through a window. In an emergency, you can call out or press a buzzer to get help. Some patients even fall asleep during longer MRI scans!

After the scan, a radiologist will review the images. They arespecially trained doctors who can spot injuries and abnormalities. If needed, the radiologist will talk with your doctor about what the MRI results mean and plan next steps.

MRIs are better than x-rays because they show soft tissues, not just bones. The scans give doctors important information to diagnose problems like tumors, injuries, strokes, and multiple sclerosis. MRIs even let doctors see how blood flows in veins and arteries. Pretty amazing stuff for some magnets and radio waves!

## Glossary

- radiologist - a doctor who specializes in interpreting imaging tests like x-rays, CT scans, and MRIs
