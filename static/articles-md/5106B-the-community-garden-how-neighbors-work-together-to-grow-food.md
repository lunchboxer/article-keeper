# The Community Garden: How Neighbors Work Together to Grow Food

Do you like digging in the dirt? Do you wish you could grow yummy fruits and veggies? Join a community garden!

A community garden is a place where neighbors share land to grow plants. They split up the land into smaller areas called plots. Then people take care of their own little plot.

Long ago during World War Two, people started community gardens. There was not enough food in cities. Gardens let people grow their own food. Nowadays, gardens help neighbors make friends.

## How Do Community Gardens Work?

First, a group finds some land to use. It could be at a school, church, or empty lot. They divide the land into plots. Next, people sign up for a plot. They pay dues to help buy tools and soil.

Gardeners plant fruits, vegetables, flowers and herbs. Carrots, tomatoes, and pumpkins grow! Some gardens add beehives and berry bushes too. Paths and benches make the garden a nice place to relax.

There are rules about tools and water. If someone goes on vacation, a neighbor will water their plot. At harvest time, extra produce is donated to food pantries.

## Gardening Together

Community gardens are fun! Kids learn about nature by planting seeds. They watch tiny sprouts grow into big plants. Eating a juicy tomato right off the vine tastes so good!

Grownups share tips on growing tasty crops. More experienced gardeners teach beginners. Lifelong friendships start in the gardens. People help each other dig up huge pumpkins and pick berries.

Community spirit grows along with the plants. Gardening as a group creates special bonds.

## Why Have Community Gardens?

Community gardens do a lot of good! They:

- Provide yummy fruits and veggies
- Give people exercise
- Help save money on food
- Make neighborhoods prettier
- Give pollinators like bees a home
- Let people make new friends
- Teach kids about nature

Let's get together and grow a beautiful community garden!
