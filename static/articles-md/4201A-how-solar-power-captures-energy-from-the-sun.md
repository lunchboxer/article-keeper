# How Solar Power Captures Energy From The Sun

Have you ever wondered how solar panels work? Solar panels are able to capture the energy from the sun and turn it into electricity that we can use to power things in our homes and schools. It's pretty amazing that the sun's energy can be used to give electricity to our lights, appliances and devices!

The sun produces an enormous amount of energy called solar energy. Solar energy travels to the Earth in waves of radiation called photons. When these photons reach the solar panels, they knock electrons loose from the atoms in a layer at the top of the panel called the photovoltaic layer. The photovoltaic layer is made up of a special material called a semiconductor that is very good at freeing electrons when hit by photons.

As the photons knock electrons loose, they leave the atoms with a positive charge and create a flow of electricity. The electrons gather along metal plates on one side of the panel, while the remaining positive charges gather along metal plates on the other side. This difference in charges between the two sides creates an electric field. By connecting wires to the metal plates, we can gather the electricity and send it where we need it, like to lightbulbs in our homes!

Solar panels work best when they are pointed directly at the sun so that the most photons hit the panel. That's why you often see solar panels arranged in rows and angled toward the south. The panels track the movement of the sun across the sky and tilt themselves to get the most sunlight during the day.

Solar power is considered a renewable source of energy because it comes from the sun, which will keep producing sunlight for billions of years to come. We will never run out of the sun's energy! Solar is also better for the environment than burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, which cause climate change and pollution. Solar energy produces no emissions or pollution.

Using solar power means we rely less on fossil fuels. Right now, solar provides only about 1-2% of the total electricity used in the United States. But solar energy use is growing very fast as more people and businesses install solar panels. Some experts think that solar could provide up to 30-40% of America's electricity by the year 2050. That would be a big help in fighting climate change!

Installing solar panels has gotten much less expensive over the last 10 years too. Governments offer tax credits and rebates to homeowners that go solar, which saves money on the installation costs. Once the panels are installed, the sunlight is free! This makes solar power a smart choice both for people's wallets and for the planet.

So next time you see a solar panel, think about the amazing technology that allows us to harvest the sun's abundant energy! The power of the sun will be key to lighting up homes and businesses in the future with clean, renewable solar energy.

## Glossary

- **photons** - Particles of light and other forms of energy released by the sun that travel to Earth.
- **photovoltaic** - A material like silicon that generates electricity when exposed to sunlight. Used in solar panels.
