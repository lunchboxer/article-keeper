# Art for the ages: Masterpieces of ancient art and sculpture

Art and sculpture from long ago can teach us a lot about how people lived back then. Artists made paintings, statues, pottery, and jewelry. Their artworks showed what was important to their culture. Some of these ancient works of art are so amazing, we still enjoy them today!

One famous ancient artwork is the Seated Scribe statue from Egypt. This statue was carved between 2620 BCE and 2500 BCE. That's over 4,500 years ago! The statue shows a man sitting down, wearing a long skirt and holding a papyrus scroll on his lap. This was probably a government official who kept records for Egypt's king. His job was very important. The artist showed this by making the scribe's face look focused and wise.

Another amazing ancient sculpture is Discobolus, a Greek statue from about 460 BCE. The discus thrower statue shows an athlete getting ready to throw a heavy disc. The sculptor captured the athlete twisting his body and winding up before the throw. The statue looks so real, like a photo of someone about to launch the disc! This realistic style was very new in ancient Greek times. It influenced sculptors for centuries to come.

Some of the most famous ancient art comes from cave paintings. In Indonesia, there are cave paintings that are over 40,000 years old! These paintings show animal hunts and spiritual ceremonies. They give us a glimpse into what life was like tens of thousands of years ago. In Spain, the famous Altamira cave paintings are over 35,000 years old. They show different animals like bison, horses, and deer. These cave paintings prove humans have been creating art since prehistoric times.

Ancient pottery also shows us what life was like long ago. The Greeks painted scenes of daily life on their pottery vases. Many vases show images of men exercising in the gymnasium. Others show glimpses of women weaving cloth. These vase paintings let us peek into what a normal day was like thousands of years ago in ancient Greece!

Art sometimes reflects what a culture finds most precious. For the ancient Egyptians, their elaborate gold jewelry contained gems and symbols to represent life and protection. To the ancient Maya people, colorful pottery with religious images was incredibly valuable. These cultures poured their heart and soul into creating masterpieces. Lucky for us, some of these incredible ancient works of art survive today for all to enjoy!
