# Vanishing Rainforests - Exploring why the lungs of the planet are disappearing

Hey kids! Rainforests are really important for the Earth and all living things. They are called the "lungs" of the planet because they make so much of the air we breathe. But rainforests are going away fast. Let's learn why this is happening and how it affects you and me.

What are rainforests? They are forests that get tons of rain every year - over 4 feet! The rain lets cool plants and animals live there. Like frogs, jaguars, monkeys, sloths, colorful birds, and even fish called piranhas! Lots of these only live in rainforests.

Rainforests used to take up about 14% of land on Earth. Now just 6%. Every year about 46,000 square miles get cut down. That's the size of the state of Pennsylvania! At this rate, rainforests may disappear while you're still a kid.

Why are they going away so fast? One reason is logging. Loggers cut down huge areas to take the trees. The wood is used for furniture, paper, and products you use daily. Farmers also clear land for farms and cows. 

When rainforests go away, many plants and animals that lived only there will disappear from Earth forever. We've already lost many we can never get back. Losing rainforests also changes the climate. Cutting them releases heat-trapping carbon into the air. With fewer trees, there's less rain overall in rainforest areas.

But we can all help save rainforests! Here's how:

- Use less paper so fewer trees get cut.
- Ask your family to buy rainforest-safe wood and paper items. 
- Eat less beef since cows need rainforest land.
- Tell friends and family to help protect rainforests.

Let's do our part to keep these awesome rainforests and creatures around. The Earth depends on them!
