# How a Humble Texas Zoo Became a World-Class Attraction: The Story of Zoos

The Fort Worth Zoo in Texas started out very small. It had only a few animals and exhibits. Not many people visited. But over many years it grew into one of the best zoos ever! This is the story of how a tiny Texas zoo became famous around the world.

In the 1960s, the Fort Worth Zoo was tiny. It had about 10 exhibits and just a couple hundred animals. Most people in Fort Worth did not even know it was there! The zoo did not have much money for new things. But in the early 1970s, that started to change. A new boss named Rick Barongi took over. He wanted to make the zoo world-class.

Barongi got more money from the city for the zoo. He used it to build cool new exhibits. One was an African Savannah area. For the first time, the zoo had rhinos, zebras, lions and other African animals all together outdoors. Visitors loved walking through and seeing them up close!

The new exhibits were very popular. More and more people came to the zoo. By the late 1970s, twice as many people visited as before. With more visitors spending money, the zoo could add more habitats and animals. They built a rainforest building and a space for Asian elephants. The Fort Worth Zoo was becoming famous in Texas!

In the 1980s and 90s, the zoo kept getting bigger. They added lots more animals like giraffes, gorillas and chimps. One of the favorite new exhibits was Texas Wild! It has armadillos, longhorns, prairie dogs and other Texas creatures. By 2000, the zoo had over 5,000 animals from around the world. From small beginnings, it had become world-class.

Today, the Fort Worth Zoo has over 500 types of animals and over one million visitors a year. It has kayaks, a carousel, a train and fun rides. But it stays true to its Texas roots. For a one-of-a-kind wildlife adventure in Texas, the Fort Worth Zoo is a must-see!
