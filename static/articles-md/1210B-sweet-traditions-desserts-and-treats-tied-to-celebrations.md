# Sweet Traditions: Desserts and Treats Tied to Celebrations

Yummy! Who doesn't like a yummy treat? All around the world, different cultures have tasty desserts that they eat during special celebrations. Let's look at some of these sweet traditions!

In the United States, every 4th of July has apple pie! This classic treat was brought by European settlers. Apples were easy to find, so colonists often baked them into pies. Eating apple pie on Independence Day became a patriotic tradition. Even today, nothing says U-S-A like warm apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

Mexico has a very egg-citing Easter tradition - cascarones! Cascarones are chicken eggs that are hollowed out and filled with confetti. People break them over each other's heads for good luck. Originally, cascarones were made with simple materials like tissue paper. Now, colorful plastic confetti is used instead. After cracking a cascarone on someone's head, bits of confetti stick to their hair and clothes. It's a fun and festive way to celebrate Easter!

In China, mooncakes are an autumn tradition. This holiday celebrates the biggest and brightest full moon of the year. Round mooncakes look like the harvest moon. Traditional mooncake fillings are sweet bean paste, lotus seed paste, or egg yolk paste. New versions even have chocolate, cheesecake, or ice cream fillings! No matter the filling, mooncakes are for sharing while looking at the pretty autumn moon.

India's Diwali festival has many yummy desserts, but ladoo are extra popular. These bite-size balls are made from flour, nuts, and sugar syrup. Different regions have different recipes, with various spices and flavors. No Diwali party is complete without a tray of colorful, stacked ladoos. Friends and families trade these sweets while wishing each other a happy new year.

In Japan, mochi rice cakes are a New Year's tradition. Mochi is made from sticky rice paste pounded into shape. It starts out very stretchy and sticky! Mochi is then shaped into little cakes and cooked until firm. Plain mochi has a mild, chewy taste. It's often stuffed with sweet bean paste, served with soy powder, or used in soup. Pounding mochi takes hard work, so eating it brings good luck in the new year.

All around the world, holidays and celebrations bring families and friends together. Sharing traditional sweets is one way to spread joy and best wishes. Even across different cultures, these treats remind us how food can connect people. Tasting these foods teaches about traditions near and far. And no matter where theyâ€™re from, who can say no to a little something sweet? Dig in and find out the yummy stories desserts can tell!
