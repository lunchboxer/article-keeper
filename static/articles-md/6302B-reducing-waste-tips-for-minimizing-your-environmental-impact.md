# Reducing Waste - Tips for minimizing your environmental impact

Hey kids! Do you want to help take care of the planet and make less trash? Making little changes in what we do every day can really help. Here are some easy ideas to make less garbage:

## Take Your Own Bags

Plastic shopping bags get used for just a few minutes. But they can sit in landfills for hundreds of years! Next time you go to the store, take a reusable bag. This makes less plastic trash. Cloth bags work best, but even reusable plastic bags help. Making your bags easy to spot by adding fun decorations or your name.

## Skip the Straw

Americans use over 500 million straws every single day! Straws are one of the worst trash in the ocean. When you can, skip the straw or bring your own reusable one made of metal or silicone. Your drink will taste the same, and fish and turtles will thank you.

## Recycle Correctly

Recycling keeps waste out of landfills. Check if your town recycles paper, plastic, glass, and metals. Make sure to rinse food off stuff before putting it in the recycling bin. Keep different types of recycling separate. Put recycling bins in easy to find places at home.

## Bring a Reusable Water Bottle

Bottles of water make tons of plastic trash every year. Carry a reusable bottle and fill it up at water fountains instead of buying plastic bottles. Try different kinds like aluminum, stainless steel, or plastic that does not contain BPA. Don't forget to wash it!

## Pack a Waste-Free Lunch

Disposable lunch stuff like baggies, foil, and sandwich wraps get thrown out after one use. To make less trash, pack lunch in containers you can use again. Use a lunchbox or bag instead of paper bags. Bring cloth napkins and metal forks and spoons from home. Taking a little more time makes a lunch that is better for the planet.

## Buy in Bulk

Buying big amounts of stuff without lots of packaging makes less trash than individually wrapped items. Go to stores where you can scoop pasta, cereal, or snacks into containers from home. Bulk foods are often cheaper too! Just buy what you'll eat so nothing gets wasted.

Following these tips will make less waste and keep the planet cleaner. What other ideas can you think of? Working together, small things we do make a big difference. The earth and future generations will thank you!
