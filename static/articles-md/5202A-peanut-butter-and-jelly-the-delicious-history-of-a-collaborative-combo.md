# Peanut Butter and Jelly: The Delicious History of a Collaborative Combo

What's better than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Not much! This delicious combo has been a favorite snack for kids and adults for over a hundred years. But how did peanut butter and jelly become the perfect pair? Grab a glass of milk and let's learn about the tasty history behind this classic sandwich.

Peanut butter has been around for centuries. Ancient Incas in South America were among the first known people to grind peanuts into paste. In the late 1800s, peanut butter started gaining popularity in the United States. Health food advocates promoted it as a nutritious protein source.

The timing couldn't have been better. A doctor named George Washington Carver had just discovered hundreds of uses for peanuts, including recipes for peanut cookies, ice cream, and peanut butter. Peanut butter quickly became a pantry staple across America.

Around the same time, fruit preserves like jelly were rising in popularity. Advances in food processing allowed jams and jellies to be produced commercially. By the 1920s, major brands like Welch's and Smucker's were selling jelly by the jarful.

Though peanut butter and jelly had both been around for decades, it wasn't until the 1920s that people started combining them. Recipes for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches began appearing in cookbooks in the late 1920s. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches became even more popular. They provided an inexpensive, filling meal during tough economic times.

Soldiers fighting in World War II also fueled the peanut butter and jelly craze. The military served peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in soldiers' rations because they were portable and nonperishable. When soldiers returned home after the war, they helped popularize the sandwich across the country.

The 1950s cemented peanut butter and jelly's status as an American favorite. Average Joes and celebrities alike relished the simple but delicious combo. Elvis Presley famously loved fried peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. In fact, he once flew across the country on his private jet just to eat one!

Today, Americans consume more than $800 million worth of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches each year. From school lunchboxes to late night snacks, peanut butter and jelly continues to be a tasty tradition passed down through generations. Who knew that peanuts and fruit could pair so perfectly between two slices of bread? The unique collaboration between peanut butter and jelly is a testament to the greatness that can happen when two good things join forces.
