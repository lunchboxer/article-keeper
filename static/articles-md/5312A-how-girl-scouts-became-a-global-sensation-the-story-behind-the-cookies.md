# How Girl Scouts Became a Global Sensation: The Story Behind the Cookies

Girl Scouts of the USA is one of the largest and most successful organizations for girls in the world. But it wasn't always that way. The Girl Scouts started very small, with just 18 girls, in 1912. Since then, it has grown into a huge organization with over 2 million girl members and 800,000 adult volunteers!

One of the reasons the Girl Scouts grew so fast is because of their famous cookie sales. The cookie program started in 1917 as a way for troops to raise money for activities. Back then, the cookies were homemade by the Scouts themselves. Can you imagine baking thousands of cookies by hand?

In 1922, the Girl Scouts began partnering with commercial bakers to produce the cookies. This made the whole process much easier. By 1936, cookie sales had become a nationwide program. Now, the Girl Scouts sell over 200 million boxes of cookies every year!

The most popular Girl Scout cookies are Thin Mints, Samoas, and Tagalongs. New cookies are introduced occasionally, but those three are classics that people love. The cookies only cost a few dollars per box, but the sales add up fast. Troops keep some of the money to fund activities and trips. The rest goes back to the Girl Scout councils to keep the organization running.

Selling cookies takes hard work and commitment. The girls learn valuable skills like money management, public speaking, and goal setting. Cookie sales teach them confidence and business savvy. When you buy Girl Scout cookies, you’re supporting so much more than just delicious treats! You’re helping empower the next generation of female leaders.

So next time Girl Scouts knock on your door, buy a box (or five)! Not only will you get to enjoy cookies like Thin Mints and Samoas, you’ll be supporting an amazing organization. From a small group of 18 in 1912 to millions worldwide today, the Girl Scouts and their famous cookies have definitely made their mark!
