# Exploring How Your Mood Affects What Art You Enjoy

Have you ever noticed that certain songs or movies make you feel happy when you’re in a good mood but sad when you’re feeling down? Our mood can totally change how we experience art!

Today we’re going to learn about how your emotions can influence what kinds of art you like at any given time. We’ll also explore why you might be in the mood for one song versus another song. Get ready to have your mind blown about how your feelings shape your taste!

Let’s start with music. When you’re happy, songs with a fast tempo and major key often sound upbeat and fun to listen to. Songs like “Happy” by Pharrell Williams can make you want to dance and sing. But that same song might seem annoying if you’re angry or sad.

Meanwhile, slower, minor key songs can match a more serious mood. Songs like “Someone Like You” by Adele might make you feel understood if you just went through a breakup. But if you’re excited for a party, that tearjerker would totally kill your buzz!

What’s going on here? Well, psychologists think our brains are wired to seek out art that fits how we already feel. So if you’re sad, your mind looks for sad stuff to listen to or watch. It’s like your emotions are drawn to art that mirrors them. Wild, right?

The colors and imagery in visual art can also appeal more to certain moods. When you’re anxious, artwork with bold colors or jarring images might feel intense in a bad way. But if you’re calm, that same edgy art could be intriguing. Meanwhile, soft, blurry paintings might relax you if you’re stressed but bore you if you’re looking for excitement.

Your surroundings and hormones likely affect your art tastes too. For example, a spooky painting might perfectly suit Halloween but seem weird in July. And your fluctuating hormones during adolescence could make you crave more emotionally intense art. Adults often have more stable preferences as their hormones level out.

Even your most beloved art can seem meh when your state of mind changes. Just think of a time when your favorite feel-good flick failed to lift your spirits during a bad day. It’s not that the movie was any less awesome - your funky mood just overpowered its magic!

The next time you press play on a song or load up a movie, pay attention to how it makes you feel. Does it perfectly capture your current state, or does it clash with your mood? Becoming aware of these patterns can help you better understand your emotions.

So embrace the songs that speak to your sad days, and pump up the jams that match your joy. Art is here to meet you wherever you’re at!
