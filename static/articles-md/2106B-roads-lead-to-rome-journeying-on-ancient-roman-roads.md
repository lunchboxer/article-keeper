# Roads lead to Rome: Journeying on ancient Roman roads

A very long time ago, the ancient Romans built many roads across Europe. The roads helped the Romans control their big empire. They used the roads to move their armies fast. Let's take a fun pretend trip on these old roads. We'll learn more about how the Romans traveled!

Our trip starts in Rome. Rome was the main city of the Roman Empire. From Rome, stone roads stretch out in all directions. Some roads go north to where England is now. Others go east to Greece. Some go south to Africa.

The roads are very straight and flat. That makes travel easy. Miles and miles of paved stone means no bumps or mud to get stuck in! Stone bridges help people cross rivers and canyons.

As we walk down the road, we see milestones. These are stone columns. They are placed every 1,000 paces. That's about one mile. Milestones tell travelers how far they are from Rome.

Along the way we see rest stops called waystations. At waystations, travelers can get fresh horses, food, and rest. Waystations make the long trip easier.

After a few days of walking, we see a stone archway. It's at the entrance to a town. Towns often built pretty arches beside roads leading in.

Inside the busy town we see shops, temples, theaters and more! People crowd the streets selling things like food, pots, fabrics, and animals. Goods traveled fast on Roman roads.

Leaving town, we walk down the stone road. Up ahead is a group of Roman soldiers. Their armor clanks as they march. Roads let Romans move armies fast wherever needed.

The Roman roads connected their huge empire. Our fun pretend trip shows us how the roads helped Romans travel, trade, and control their land. Their saying was all roads lead to Rome!
