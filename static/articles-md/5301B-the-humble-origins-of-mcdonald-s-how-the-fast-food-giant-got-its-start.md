# The Humble Origins of McDonald's: How the Fast Food Giant Got Its Start

A long time ago, before it was so big, McDonald's was just a little restaurant owned by two brothers. Their names were Richard and Maurice McDonald.

In the 1930s, Richard and Maurice first started a hot dog stand in California. But their hot dog stand did not make much money.

In 1948, the brothers closed their hot dog stand. They opened a new restaurant that sold burgers and fries instead. They called it McDonald's Famous Barbecue.

At this new McDonald's, the brothers saw that most people bought hamburgers and fries. So they only sold burgers, fries, sodas, and shakes.

The brothers also found ways to make the food really fast. They set up the kitchen like an assembly line to cook burgers quick. People ordered at a counter, got their food in a bag, and found their own seat. This made everything go faster.

With its fast service and yummy cheap burgers, people loved the new McDonald's. But it was still just one small restaurant.

That changed when a man named Ray Kroc visited in 1954. He saw how well the restaurant worked and made a deal to open more McDonald's all over America.

Ray Kroc turned McDonald's into a huge company. By 1958, they had sold 100 million burgers! McDonald's grew very fast after that. Today there are McDonald's in over 100 countries around the world.

When you go to a McDonald's now, you can see they still use the original ideas. The food comes fast. You order at a counter and find your seat. The menu is still burgers, fries, sodas, and shakes.

So next time you eat a Big Mac and fries, remember how McDonald's started small in California. The fast service and yummy food you like came from the McDonald brothers' ideas over 70 years ago!
