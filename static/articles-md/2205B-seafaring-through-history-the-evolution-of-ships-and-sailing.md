# Seafaring through history: The evolution of ships and sailing

People have been using boats to travel on water for thousands of years! Boats have changed a lot over time. Keep reading to learn about some of the different boats and ships people have used for sailing throughout history!

In ancient times, the first boats were just logs or bundles of reeds that floated. People used them to get across rivers or go short distances near land. Around 3,000 BC, ancient Egyptians started building wooden sailboats. The sails allowed the wind to push the boats and make them go faster. Their boats had masts to hold up the sails and keels to help steer.

By 2000 BC, Phoenicians built the first real warships called galleys. Galleys had sails and oars, so they could keep moving even without wind. Phoenicians used galleys to explore, trade goods, and even battle other ships. During the Middle Ages, galleys kept being used to carry soldiers into sea battles.

In the 1400s, Europeans began sailing across oceans to reach new places. They needed bigger, sturdier ships to travel long distances across the sea. In the 1500s, the Spanish made galleons. Galleons could have up to three decks for cannons and carry more cargo. Their designs let them sail far on rough waters.

More big changes happened in the 1600s. The British created faster, more stable ships called frigates. Frigates had sleek shapes that cut through waves, unlike bulky galleons. Around this time, merchants also started using clipper ships. Clippers had tall masts and lots of sails, making them extremely speedy. They set records carrying goods around the world.

Steam power changed sailing in the 1800s. Steamships had engines and propellers instead of just sails. The SS Great Britain, built in 1843, was the first big steamship that could cross oceans. Steam let huge steel ships carry more goods and people than ever before.

In the early 1900s, oil replaced steam to power most big ships. Giant oil-driven ships like ocean liners and aircraft carriers ruled the seas through World War II. Today, many large ships use oil or diesel fuel. But new technologies like solar, wind, and hydrogen are now giving us cleaner ways to sail!

Over time, ships went from small reed rafts to massive cruise ships and cargo ships. Sails were replaced by steam, then oil and diesel. Our sailing skills expanded trade, exploration, and war around the world. What exciting changes will ships have in the future? Keep your eye out for new inventions!
