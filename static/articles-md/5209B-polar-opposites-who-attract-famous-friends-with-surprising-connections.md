# Polar Opposites Who Attract: Famous Friends with Surprising Connections

Sometimes friends who seem really different end up getting along great! This is called “opposites attract”. Keep reading to find out about some famous friends who don’t seem like they’d be BFFs.

First up are the funny guys Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. Mel makes hilarious, wacky comedies. Carl’s movies are more gentle and smart. Even though their humor is different, Mel and Carl clicked right away when they met in the 1950s. They’ve stayed super close ever since. At one point, they were next-door neighbors!

Another surprise pair is former president George W. Bush and rock star Bono. Yup, a Republican politician and a liberal singer became good friends! What brought them together was wanting to help fight AIDS in Africa. Bono’s charity worked with Bush’s government to send aid to Africa. Though they disagree on some things, Bono says he and George W. still “get along fine.”

Here’s a friendship you probably wouldn’t predict - Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. Martha is the ultimate homemaker and Snoop is a famous rapper. They seem really different! But in 2008, Martha and Snoop met on TV and clicked. They realized they both love being creative and cooking. Now Martha and Snoop are total BFFs. They’ve cooked and baked together on TV. Snoop even calls Martha “Martha Stewaty” as a cute nickname.

Next up are two famous actresses who got close: Gwyneth Paltrow and Jay-Z. Gwyneth has a fancy lifestyle and eats healthy. Jay-Z is a big rap star and businessman. Even with their different images, Gwyneth and Jay-Z bonded over loving their hometown of New York. Gwyneth says Jay is “one of the nicest people I know” and they text every week.

The last odd couple is comedians Larry David and Bernie Sanders. Larry made the hit show Seinfeld and plays a grumpy guy. Bernie ran for president as a fiery progressive. But these two Brooklyn guys have been friends for years. Larry even does funny impressions of Bernie on TV. Though they joke around, Larry and Bernie both care about politics and baseball.
