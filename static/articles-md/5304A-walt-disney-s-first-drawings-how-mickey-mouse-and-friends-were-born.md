# Walt Disney's First Drawings: How Mickey Mouse and Friends Were Born

Walt Disney is one of the most famous animators and entertainers in history. He created Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and so many other beloved cartoon characters. But how did Walt Disney first get started drawing the characters we know and love today?

Back when Walt Disney was a little boy in the early 1900s, he loved to draw. He would sketch farm animals on scraps of paper and flip through the pages to make them move. As a teenager, Walt began taking art classes and made cartoons for his high school newspaper.

After high school, Walt moved to Kansas City. That's where he made his first cartoon character named Newman Laugh-O-Grams. Newman was a little boy who would get into silly situations. The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons were popular, but Walt ran out of money before he could make more.

So Walt packed up and moved to Hollywood. Things didn't go well at first. He started a new company called Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. But their cartoons weren't big hits. The company was struggling.

One day, Walt was on the train ride home after a disappointing business meeting. To pass the time, he began sketching a little mouse. The mouse had big round ears and a long thin tail. Walt named him Mortimer Mouse. But his wife Lillian thought the name sounded too formal. So they changed it to the friendlier Mickey Mouse.

In 1928, Walt Disney created a cartoon called Plane Crazy starring Mickey Mouse. It didn't get much attention. Later that year, Walt made another Mickey cartoon called Steamboat Willie. It was a big hit because it was one of the first cartoons with sound. Mickey whistles, dances, and sings a silly song. Audiences loved this playful mouse!

After Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse became incredibly popular. Walt and his team worked hard to produce more Mickey cartoons like The Barn Dance and The Opry House. People couldn't get enough of Mickey's adventures. He even started appearing in comic strips and on all sorts of products. Mickey was everywhere!

Walt didn't stop with Mickey. In 1934, he introduced Donald Duck in the cartoon The Wise Little Hen. Donald had a fiery temper that made audiences laugh. Then in 1935, the lovable dog Goofy made his debut in Mickey's Service Station. Pluto the puppy and Minnie Mouse joined in too. Walt had created a whole cast of fun animal characters.

For decades, Walt Disney made magical cartoons that brought joy to kids and adults worldwide. And it all started with a simple sketch of a little mouse on a train ride. That mouse grew into the iconic Mickey Mouse, who will be popular for generations to come. Walt once said, "I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing...that it was all started by a mouse."
