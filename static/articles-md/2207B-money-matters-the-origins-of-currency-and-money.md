# Money matters: The origins of currency and money

What do you use when you buy a candy bar or new toy? Money! Money lets us buy things. But money was not always coins and bills. A long time ago, people traded to get what they needed. Keep reading to learn where money came from!

In the old days, people traded goods instead of using money. Trading goods is called bartering. Let's say a farmer wanted a bag. The farmer could give the bag maker some corn in exchange for a bag. But what if the bag maker didn't want corn? The farmer would be out of luck!

People saw there were problems with bartering. So they started using valuable things as money. Different stuff was used in different places. Rice, salt, animal skins, or metals could be money.

Around 600 B.C., the first coins were made from metal. These early coins were made of electrum. That's a mix of gold and silver. Coins worked better than bartering because they had a set value. You could buy things even if the seller didn't want your pigs or wheat! Coins were easy to carry too.

Later, paper money was invented in China around 800 A.D. Paper money was lighter than heavy metal coins. But paper money had problems too. Rats might nibble on it, or it could burn up!

Now we use digital money on computers and phones. Digital money means you don't need real paper bills or coins. But if your phone dies, you can't use your digital money!

Money sure has changed over time! From trading pigs to swiping a card, money makes getting stuff much easier. Learning about money's history helps us see why it's so useful!
