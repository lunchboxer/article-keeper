# Biomass: How plant and animal waste can produce energy

Get ready to be amazed! Trash and plants can actually make energy to power your home. It's true! This is called biomass energy.

Biomass means plant and animal materials. These include wood, corn stalks, and even cow poop. Gross but true! Biomass can be changed into electricity, fuel for cars and trucks, and heat for buildings.

Most biomass comes from growing plants. As plants grow up from seeds, they use sunlight to make food and plant material. This stores the sun's energy in the plant. When plants die or get cut down, the energy stays inside. For example, trees have lots of energy in their trunks and branches that can be released by burning the wood. The same is true for leftover corn stalks and sugarcane fibers.

Yucky but true - animal waste and garbage have biomass too. Cow poop and old food in landfills break down over time and make methane gas. This gas can be gathered and used for energy.

Here are some ways to turn biomass into usable energy:

- Burning - Biomass can be burned to produce heat for buildings, or to make steam that spins turbines for making electricity. For instance, burning wood chips or sugarcane waste.

- Biofuels - Biomass from corn, sugarcane, and plants can be processed into liquid fuels like ethanol to replace gasoline for cars and trucks. Awesome!

- Landfill gas - Pipes are put in landfills to collect methane gas from all the rotting garbage. This gas can then provide energy to make electricity or power vehicles. Double whammy!

Using biomass for energy has lots of pluses. First, it reduces trash going to landfills. It also gives us a renewable fuel that isn't used up, since we can keep growing more plants for biomass. And unlike oil, coal, and natural gas, burning biomass doesn't add extra carbon dioxide to the air. This is because the plants already soaked up that carbon as they grew. Pretty cool!

However, some challenges exist too. It takes land, water and other stuff to grow the biomass. Burning it can cause air pollution. And some places don't have a lot of plant material around to use. But scientists are working to make cleaner and better ways to convert biomass to energy.

The future is bright for biomass energy. As we get better at capturing landfill gas, making biofuels, and using waste smartly, biomass could give us more and more clean energy. So when you take out the trash or rake leaves, think about the potential energy that could be used wisely instead of wasted. Plants and waste can help power our world!

## Glossary

- biofuels - Fuels like ethanol made from plants and animal stuff instead of oil.
- biomass - Plants and animal materials, like wood, waste, crops and algae, that can provide energy.
- carbon dioxide - A gas that comes from burning fuels like oil, coal, and biomass. Too much causes air pollution and climate change.
- methane - A clean gas fuel made as trash breaks down in landfills. It can be captured and used for energy.
- turbines - Fast spinning devices that generate electricity.
