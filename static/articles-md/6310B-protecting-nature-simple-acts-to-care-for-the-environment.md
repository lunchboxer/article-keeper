# Protecting Nature - Simple acts to care for the environment

There are lots of easy ways kids can help take care of the environment. Here are some simple things you can do to protect nature and wildlife where you live!

## Use Less Water

When you use water from the sink or shower, try to use only what you need. Take short showers that last 5 minutes or less. Turn the water off when you brush your teeth. Make sure sinks and hoses are turned all the way off so they don't drip. Using less water saves this important resource.

## Recycle and Reuse

Instead of throwing away bottles, cans, paper and other things that can be recycled, put them in your recycling bin. See if you can recycle at school too. Reuse things like plastic containers or bags instead of throwing them away. Recycling and reusing things means less trash in landfills.

## Plant a Garden

It's fun to grow your own fruits, vegetables or flowers! Planting plants that naturally grow in your area gives food and homes to local animals like birds, butterflies and bees. Having a garden means stores don't have to truck food as far.

## Ride Your Bike

Riding your bike or walking instead of driving helps keep the air clean. It's also great exercise! See if you can bike or walk to school, friends' houses or activities instead of always getting rides.

## Pick Up Litter

Don't just walk by trash on the ground - pick it up! Litter can hurt animals and make our neighborhoods look messy. Get friends together to clean up litter in your community. Taking care of the environment starts right by your home.

## Turn Off Lights

Don't leave lights on in empty rooms. Make sure lights get turned off when you leave a room. Using less electricity means fewer power plants have to burn fuel, which reduces pollution.

Protecting nature and wildlife might seem big, but when we work together on simple things every day, it makes a difference. Our planet gives us the air, water and food we need - so let's take good care of it!
