# Being a Changemaker - Kids who changed the world and how you can too

Do you want to make the world a better place? Many kids just like you have done amazing things to help people and the planet. With passion and creativity, you can be a changemaker too!

Greta Thunberg started a worldwide movement about climate change. When she was 15 years old, she protested alone outside Sweden’s parliament building. She held a sign that read “School Strike for Climate.” Greta skipped school on Fridays to protest. Soon, kids around the world began skipping school on Fridays to demand action on climate change. Greta showed that one person can spark a big movement.

Ryan Hickman started recycling cardboard at age 3. By age 5, he had recycled over 200,000 cans and bottles! Ryan uses the money he earns from recycling to donate toys and food to people in need. He also gives speeches to inspire other kids to recycle. Ryan proves you’re never too young to make a difference.

At age 6, Vivian Lord got upset seeing homeless people in her community. She decided to build them tiny houses. Vivian raised money by making bracelets and lemonade. With over $16,000 raised, she built 12 tiny houses! Vivian shows how small acts of kindness can go a long way.

So how can you be a changemaker? Follow your passion! What problems do you want to solve? Homelessness, hunger, pollution? Think big, but start small. Raise money by holding a bake sale or car wash. Volunteer at a food bank or animal shelter. Clean up trash in your neighborhood.

Invent something new that helps people or the environment. Or start a club at school to spread awareness. Make videos, artwork, or write letters to leaders about issues you care about.

Most importantly, don’t give up if you face challenges. It takes time to make real change. Stay positive and keep trying new ideas. The most successful changemakers are creative, courageous, and determined. They believe in themselves and inspire others.

No matter your age or talents, you can improve the world. Follow your dreams to be a changemaker. The future depends on kids like you!
