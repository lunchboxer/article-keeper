# Ruling the Roost: Comparing Ancient Rulers to Modern Leaders

Hey kids! Have you ever wondered what it was like long ago when kings and queens ruled entire lands? Well, being an ancient ruler was a lot different than leading a country today. Kings and queens from long ago had all the power over their kingdoms. They made all the rules that people had to follow. Some ancient rulers were nice and took good care of the people they ruled over. But others let all their power go to their heads and became mean tyrants!

Let's look at some famous rulers from ancient times and see how they compare to our leaders today.

## The Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt

In ancient Egypt, pharaohs were like kings. They were treated like gods on Earth and had total control over everything. Whatever the pharaoh said became law that everyone had to obey. Some pharaohs like Ramses II built huge pyramids and monuments and fought wars. Other pharaohs like King Tut became ruler when they were just kids! Today, if a president tried to rule like a pharaoh, people would think they were a dictator.

## Alexander the Great

Alexander the Great was the king of Macedonia, an ancient kingdom in Greece. During his 13-year rule, he conquered lands from Greece all the way to India! He was a brilliant army leader. The cities he took over learned about Greek culture and ideas. If a leader today tried to invade other countries like Alexander the Great did, it would start a big war!

## Emperor Qin Shi Huang

Qin Shi Huang was the first emperor of China over 2000 years ago. He joined different regions together into one Chinese Empire. His rule helped China become a strong nation that lasted over 2000 more years. But Qin Shi Huang demanded complete loyalty. He burned books that disagreed with him and buried scholars alive who questioned him. Because he was so harsh, rebellions rose up after he died. Now China's leaders understand that new ideas and dissent are important for progress.

## Julius Caesar

Julius Caesar was a Roman general who made himself dictator over Rome. He passed laws to help the poor and took over more lands for Rome. But the Roman Senate worried Caesar had too much power and planned to get rid of the Republic. So they killed him! Today's democracies have term limits and elections so that no one can rule forever like Caesar wanted to.

This quick history lesson shows us that while ancient rulers could often act like bullies, modern leaders have restrictions like constitutions, checks and balances, and the will of the people. The comparison shows how much government has changed from the days of all-powerful god-kings! So be glad you live today instead of under some grumpy ancient king!
