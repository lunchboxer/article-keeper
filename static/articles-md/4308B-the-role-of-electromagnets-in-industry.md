# The role of electromagnets in industry

Electromagnets are really neat! They are magnets that can be turned on and off using electricity. Regular magnets stick to metal all the time. But electromagnets can pick up and drop metal objects just by flipping a switch. This makes them really handy in factories and other places that build stuff.

A long time ago in 1825, a scientist from England named William Sturgeon invented the first electromagnet. He wrapped wire around an iron bar. When he ran electricity through the wire, the iron bar started acting like a magnet! Sturgeon learned you can control magnets using electricity.

Since Sturgeon's invention almost 200 years ago, engineers have found lots of uses for electromagnets. One big use is picking up and moving heavy metal stuff like cars in junkyards. The electromagnet on a crane can grab a car by turning on the electricity in the wire. When the worker wants to drop the car, they just turn off the electromagnet. This makes moving piles of metal really easy!

Electromagnets are also used in junkyards and recycling plants to separate different metal types. The electromagnet can pick up just the steel cans from a pile of trash by turning the magnet on. When the worker wants to grab the aluminum cans instead, they lower the magnet's power so it drops the steel and grabs the aluminum. Being able to sort metals fast is important for recycling.

Another use for electromagnets is in car factories. Electromagnets move sheets of steel from place to place on the assembly line. They also put car parts in the right spot for robots to weld them together. Using an electromagnet for this is way better than making a person try to lift heavy car parts all day! Electromagnets can do repetitive tasks over and over without getting tired.

One of the strongest electromagnets ever was built by scientists in New Mexico. This giant magnet can lift a whole car off the ground! Special electromagnets are also used inside MRI machines. MRI machines take pictures inside your body using magnets and radio waves. Pretty neat!

As you can see, electromagnets are super helpful in many industries. Their power to pick up and let go of metal objects makes jobs like lifting, moving, and sorting metals really easy. Electromagnets will keep getting more powerful as technology improves. Just think what future electromagnets will be able to do!
