# How Girl Scouts Became a Global Sensation: The Story Behind the Cookies

A long time ago, in 1912, Juliette Gordon Low started Girl Scouts in the United States. She wanted to give girls fun experiences and teach them important skills. At first, there were only 18 Girl Scouts! But the group grew very fast. Today, Girl Scouts has over 2 million girls who are members. It also has over 800,000 adults who volunteer their time. The Girl Scouts is one of the biggest and most successful groups for girls in the world.

One reason Girl Scouts grew so fast is because of the famous cookie sales. Girl Scouts started selling cookies in 1917 to earn money for activities. In the beginning, the Scouts baked all of the cookies themselves at home. That was a lot of work!

In 1922, Girl Scouts began teaming up with cookie companies to make the cookies instead. This was much easier than baking them all themselves! By 1936, selling cookies had spread across the whole United States. Now, Girl Scouts sell over 200 million boxes of cookies every year!

The most popular cookies are Thin Mints, Samoas, and Tagalongs. Sometimes new cookies are added, but those three are classics. Cookies cost just a few dollars a box. But with millions of boxes sold, the money adds up fast! Troops keep some money for activities and trips. The rest goes back to Girl Scouts headquarters to keep the group going.

Selling cookies takes effort and dedication. The girls learn useful skills like managing money, public speaking, and reaching goals. Cookie sales teach them confidence and business skills. When you buy Girl Scout cookies, you support much more than yummy treats! You help empower the next group of girl leaders.

So when Girl Scouts come to your door, buy some cookies! You'll get to enjoy Thin Mints, Samoas, and more. And you'll be helping a wonderful group that started small in 1912 but now has millions of girls around the world. Girl Scouts and their famous cookies have definitely made a mark!
