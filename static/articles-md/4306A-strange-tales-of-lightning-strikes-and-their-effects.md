# Strange Tales of Lightning Strikes and Their Effects

Imagine hiking on a mountain trail when suddenly the sky turns dark and stormy. You feel tiny tingles on your skin as the hair on your arms starts to stand up. Could this be a sign that lightning is about to strike? Lightning is one of nature’s most powerful and mysterious forces. Let’s explore some tales of its strange effects on people and objects.

One odd lightning story took place on June 22, 1977 in the state of Georgia. A man named Roy Cleveland Sullivan was hit by lightning while working in Shenandoah National Park. What makes Roy’s story so peculiar is that over 35 years he was struck by lightning seven times! He even earned the nickname “Human Lightning Rod”. After so many electrifying events, Roy must have felt like a magnet for lightning bolts.

Lightning strikes can leave behind bizarre markings on the skin called Lichtenberg figures. These jagged patterns on the surface of the skin resemble ferns or tree branches. They appear due to the electricity splitting and branching out as it enters the body. Luckily, these skin patterns usually fade over time. Some people have even had Lichtenberg figures tattooed on their bodies. Now that’s a pretty shocking tattoo!

Believe it or not, lightning doesn’t just affect living things. In the country of Venezuela, there lies a remote tabletop mountain called Roraima. This flat-topped mountain has baffled geologists for decades. Roraima is covered in hundreds of maze-like patterns etched into the bare rock. When seen from above, these winding grooves resemble a giant fingerprint. What could have caused these mystifying markings? Scientists now believe they were burned into the stone by powerful lightning strikes!

Besides mountains, lightning has also struck some very unlikely objects. On June 30, 2019, a lightning bolt hit a toilet in Florida while a man was sitting on it! The lightning traveled through the pipes, giving the man a dramatic jolt on his bottom. Remarkably, he survived the bizarre incident with only minor injuries. Talk about a shocking trip to the bathroom!

Lightning can take on many odd shapes and colors as it flashes across the sky. Some people have reported seeing red lightning, blue flashes, and even forked bolts that wiggle like tentacles. What causes lightning to flaunt these crazy colors and shapes? It depends on the gases and particles that the bolt travels through. Nitrogen produces blue hues, while passing through dust and moisture creates reddish forks. Though it’s rare, next time lightning storms, keep an eye out for rainbow flashes!

NASA scientists have discovered that lightning can even happen on other planets. The gas giant Jupiter has epic thunderstorms with lightning a thousand times more powerful than on Earth! Neptune, Venus, Saturn and Uranus may also have electrical storms. Can you imagine what it would be like to witness an electrifying light show on another world? One thing is for sure - in our mysterious universe, lightning often strikes in the most alien and unexpected ways!
