# Graffiti: Artistic Expression or Crime?

Graffiti is pictures or words painted on walls or other surfaces, usually without permission. Some people think graffiti is art. Others think it is vandalism. What do you think?

Graffiti has been around for thousands of years. In ancient times, people drew on cave walls. Some of these cave paintings can still be seen today! Graffiti can also be found on buildings in ancient Pompeii and Egypt.

Modern graffiti became popular in the late 1960s. Young people used spray paint to put their names or artwork on subway trains and city walls. This was called "tagging." Tagging started in Philadelphia and New York. Some taggers were gang members marking their territory. Others were teens expressing themselves.

Soon graffiti art became a worldwide trend. By the 1980s, graffiti was common in big cities across the U.S. and Europe. Graffiti writing styles grew more elaborate. Taggers started adding cartoon characters, bubbles, and styled letters. Their tags ranged from simple to wildly colorful and complex.

Some graffiti writers see tagging as a competitive sport. They try to tag risky spots without getting caught. Others focus on creativity and style. Their paintings can be quite beautiful and artistic. Famous graffiti artists like Banksy and Shepard Fairey have created stunning and thought-provoking street art.

However, many people see all graffiti as vandalism. Tagging can be dangerous. Taggers sometimes break into train yards or climb tall buildings to "bomb" them with paint. Writing over signs or windows can make them difficult to read. Cleaning up graffiti costs cities millions of dollars per year. Plus, some graffiti promotes gang activity or inappropriate content.

Laws make it illegal to paint on public or private property without permission. Getting caught can lead to fines or even jail time. Yet graffiti continues to spread. So cities have tried finding legal ways for taggers to display their art.

Some cities provide graffiti parks or "free walls" where artists can paint legally. Cities also hire graffiti artists to create murals. These colorful artworks help decorate neighborhoods and discourage vandalism.

Do you think graffiti should be encouraged? Or should all tagging be treated as a crime? What if it was your own wall or business being tagged? The debate continues over how to handle these spray-paint creations!
