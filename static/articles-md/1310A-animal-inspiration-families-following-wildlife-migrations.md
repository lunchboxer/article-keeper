# Animal Inspiration: Families Following Wildlife Migrations

Hey kids! Have you ever wondered what it would be like to pick up and move your home every year? Well, that's exactly what many animals do when they migrate! Migration is when animals travel long distances every year, usually to find better food or more comfortable weather. Some awesome animals that migrate are wildebeests, monarch butterflies, humpback whales, and caribou. Keep reading to find out some super cool facts about these animal migrations!

In Africa, nearly two million wildebeests and hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles migrate together in a huge herd every year. This is called the Great Migration, and it's the largest overland migration in the world! The wildebeests, zebras, and gazelles follow the rains across the African plains. When rain falls, new grass sprouts up for the animals to munch on. But when the dry season starts, the grass dries up. So the herd must keep moving to find more yummy green grass to eat. Predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas follow the migration too, trying to hunt the wildebeests and zebras. The herd must stay alert and keep moving to avoid becoming dinner!

Monarch butterflies are famous for their incredible migration each year from Canada and the United States to Mexico. The monarchs fly up to 3,000 miles to reach their winter home in Mexico's forests! No single butterfly completes the entire journey. It takes several generations of monarchs to travel the whole distance over the course of a few months. Along the way, the monarchs use the sun and earth's magnetic fields to help guide their flight south. In early spring, the monarchs that arrived in Mexico fly north again - this time laying eggs along the way to produce the next generation of butterflies. What amazing navigators!

Humpback whales are gigantic marine mammals that migrate incredible distances in the oceans. Every winter, humpbacks in Alaska swim over 3,000 miles south to breeding grounds near Hawaii and Mexico. Then when spring arrives, the humpbacks make the long journey back north to Alaska to feed in its rich, cold waters. One special group swims the farthest - around 5,000 miles from eastern Australia to feed near Antarctica before heading back north to breed! Along their migration route, humpbacks sing beautiful whale songs and breach out of the water. Breaching is when the whale leaps nearly all the way out of the water before splashing down. It's quite a sight!

Caribou are medium-sized deer that are famous for their massive migrations across the tundra. Every spring and fall, hundreds of thousands of caribou migrate in herds across the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. The caribou spend summers feasting on plants and grasses in the north. But when winter arrives, food becomes scarce. So the caribou trek south again to find more food. Some herd's migrations are around 3,000 miles total per year! Caribou migrate in huge numbers for protection from predators like wolves and bears. They also work together to clear paths through deep snow. Talk about an epic road trip!

As you can see, animal migrations are pretty amazing! Animals traverse entire continents over land, sea, and air to find food, shelter, and breeding grounds. Their epic journeys connect ecosystems across the globe. Migrating animals play an important role in nature, spreading seeds, transporting nutrients, controlling insect populations, and becoming food for other creatures. We're lucky to share this awesome planet with such remarkable migrating animals!
