# Whistleblowers - Exposing wrongdoing at great risk

Have you ever seen someone being mean or doing something they shouldn’t? It’s scary to tell on them. You don’t want them to get mad at you. People who are brave enough to speak up are called **whistleblowers**. They help show lies and bad things that hurt people.

Whistleblowing means telling everyone about bad or illegal stuff that's happening. It stops people from being dishonest or hurtful. Big companies or governments sometimes try to hide what they’re doing wrong. Whistleblowers risk getting in trouble or losing their jobs to share the truth.

Some famous American whistleblowers are Daniel Ellsberg, Jeffrey Wigand, Sherron Watkins, and Edward Snowden. Ellsberg worked for the government and found out it was lying about the Vietnam War. In 1971 he gave secret documents about the war to the news. This helped end the war.

Jeffrey Wigand worked for a cigarette company. In 1996 he told how they made cigarettes more addictive on purpose. Wigand lost his job but made the company admit what it did. His story was a movie called “The Insider.”

Enron was a huge company that lied about money stuff. Sherron Watkins worked there and tried to report their lies. When no one listened, she talked to reporters. This brought down Enron’s leaders who were lying.

More recently, Edward Snowden shared secret government documents in 2013. They showed how the government spies on its own people. Snowden went to Russia so he wouldn’t get in trouble. Some say he did wrong, but some say he stood up for people’s rights.

What makes someone blow the whistle? Most do it because they think it’s wrong to hide the truth. They feel telling what’s wrong is more important than keeping secrets. First they try reporting problems through proper ways inside the company or government. If that doesn’t work, they might go public. Whistleblowing has to be about real proof, not rumors.

There are big risks to whistleblowing. Powerful wrongdoers attack the messenger instead of fixing the problem. Whistleblowers can be criticized or lose their job. Some even get threats. Governments might charge them with crimes for revealing secrets. For example, Snowden is charged with spying and theft for leaking documents.

To protect whistleblowers, some countries have passed laws. These laws stop bosses from punishing people who report bad things. In the U.S., the Whistleblower Protection Act tries to keep federal whistleblowers safe. Companies also must allow anonymous reporting of unethical stuff.

But most agree more protection is still needed. Whistleblowers put themselves in danger to help the public. Their bravery can fix broken systems and remind us to do what’s right. As the saying goes, “sunlight is the best disinfectant.” Whistleblowing shines light on bad things happening in the dark.
