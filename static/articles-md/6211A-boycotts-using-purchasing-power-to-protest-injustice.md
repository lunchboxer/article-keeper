# Boycotts - Using purchasing power to protest injustice

Have you ever wanted to speak up about something you thought was unfair or wrong? Many people feel that way sometimes. One way groups of people can protest injustice is through boycotts.

A boycott is when a group of people stop buying, using, or dealing with certain businesses or products. The goal is to put pressure on the company or organization to change whatever the group is protesting.

Boycotts have been used for hundreds of years. In the 1700s, American colonists boycotted British goods to protest unfair taxes. In the 1950s and 60s, African Americans boycotted segregated buses in Montgomery, Alabama. More recently, people have boycotted companies that test products on animals.

Boycotts work because they threaten a company's profits and public image. When enough customers stop buying, businesses have to listen. They don't want to lose money or look bad.

Of course, boycotts also hurt the people who work for those companies. So boycotters try to hurt the business itself, not regular workers. The goal is getting the company to change, not putting people out of jobs.

Some of the most famous boycotts have been led by famous leaders. In India, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott British cloth and make their own homemade fabric. In the United States, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. organized bus boycotts in the 1950s.

But anyone can start or join a boycott. The internet makes it easier than ever to spread the word about unfair practices. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook allow protesters to recruit people locally and globally.

Still, experts say the boycott must be focused clearly on one issue. It helps to have a specific goal, like getting a company to use fair trade suppliers. The protest should also suggest reasonable solutions. That makes it easier for the company to respond positively.

Of course, boycotts are just one tool for change. They work best combined with other peaceful actions like letter-writing campaigns, petitions, and demonstrations. The goal should be opening a conversation, not just punishing businesses.

Boycotts may not always achieve their exact aims. But they give ordinary citizens a nonviolent way to challenge powerful interests. That's why boycotts continue to be an important way to work for justice.
