# Robots and Magnets: How They Work Together

Have you ever wondered how robots are able to pick up and move objects around? Often, they use magnets! Robots and magnets work together in really cool ways.

Magnets are objects that create magnetic fields. These magnetic fields allow magnets to pull certain metals toward them. Robots often have magnets built into their arms, hands, or fingers. This allows them to grab and lift up metal objects.

One way robots use magnets is in junkyards. Junkyards are places where old cars, appliances, and other metal objects are kept. The robots at junkyards use strong magnets to pick up and move around heavy metal car parts and appliances. Their magnetic hands help clean up and organize the junkyard.

Another way robots use magnets is in factories. Factory robots build cars, computers, toys and other objects. They use magnetized grippers or hands to pick up, move, and assemble metal parts. The magnets allow the robots to work quickly and efficiently.

Some robots even use electromagnets instead of permanent magnets. Electromagnets can be turned on and off using electricity. This allows the robot to easily grab and release metal objects when needed.

NASA also uses robots with magnets in space! On the International Space Station, flying robots called SPHERES use magnets to connect together. Astronauts test out how to fly and assemble robots in space using these cool magnetic droids!

Magnets also help robots stick to metal surfaces. Search and rescue robots often have magnetic treads or wheels. This allows them to climb up steel walls and ceilings in damaged buildings to look for people who need help. The magnets keep the rescue robots from falling.

In the future, more advanced robots may use magnets to mimic how geckos climb. Geckos have thousands of tiny hairs on their toes that interact with molecules on surfaces, allowing them to stick to and climb walls and ceilings. Robots with synthetic gecko hairs and magnets could potentially climb just about any surface!

As you can see, magnets play an important role in helping robots grab, move, and stick to objects. Magnets allow robots to take over dangerous or repetitive jobs in junkyards, factories, space and more. Robots and magnets working together help make our world a better place! So next time you see a robot picking something up, look closely - there's probably a magnet involved.
