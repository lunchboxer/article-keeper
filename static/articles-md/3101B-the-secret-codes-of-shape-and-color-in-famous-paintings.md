# The Secret Codes of Shape and Color in Famous Paintings

When you look at paintings, do you ever wonder why the artist picked certain colors or shapes? Artists sometimes use colors and shapes to send secret messages in their art! Keep reading to find out about the hidden meanings in shapes and colors from famous paintings.

One artist who was really good at using symbols was Johannes Vermeer. He was a painter from the Netherlands. In many of Vermeer’s paintings, he used the color blue a lot. Vermeer used different shades of blue to show spiritual beauty, calmness, and harmony. For example, in his famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring, the girl wears a blue turban. The blues in the turban show the girl has inner peace and grace.

Another important symbol Vermeer used was concentric circles. Concentric circles are circles inside other circles. In Vermeer’s art, concentric circles meant unity, wholeness, and infinity. For example, in The Milkmaid, the bread and basket have concentric circles. This hints at fulfillment and balance.

Pablo Picasso was the founder of modern art. He also used symbols in his Cubist paintings. Picasso often painted triangles to stand for masculinity and strength. He painted circles to symbolize femininity and creativity.

For instance, in Picasso’s Three Musicians, the man on the left has angular triangle shapes. The other two figures have round, curvy forms. Picasso used these shapes to explore ideas about gender. The shapes show how the three musicians are connected.

Another modern artist who used symbols was Piet Mondrian. In Mondrian’s abstract paintings, he only used straight lines and three primary colors - red, blue, and yellow. Mondrian thought these colors and lines showed purity, simplicity, and harmony.

Look closely at Mondrian’s Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow. You’ll see the grid of bold colors divided by thick black lines. Mondrian carefully balanced the colors and lines to give a feeling of peace and balance.

The next time you go to an art museum, look for special shapes and colors. They might show deeper meanings about the artist and their work! Artists often hide messages in their paintings. With some detective work, you can learn to uncover the secret code of shapes and colors in famous art.
