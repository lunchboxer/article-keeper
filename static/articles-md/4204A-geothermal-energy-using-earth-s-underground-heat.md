# Geothermal energy: Using Earth's underground heat

Have you ever wondered where the heat that warms your home comes from? Most homes are heated by burning fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, or coal. But there is another source of energy under our feet that can provide heat without burning any fuels at all! This is called geothermal energy.

Geothermal energy uses the natural heat inside the Earth to provide heat for homes and buildings. The word "geo" means Earth, and "thermal" means heat. So geothermal energy is literally Earth's heat!

The inside of the Earth is very, very hot. Just a few miles below the surface, temperatures reach over 700 degrees Fahrenheit! This heat comes from when the Earth first formed billions of years ago, as well as heat produced by radioactive decay of materials like uranium deep underground.

To use geothermal energy, wells are drilled into the ground to bring up hot water or steam from deep below the surface. The water can reach temperatures over 300 degrees Fahrenheit! The hot water is then pumped through a heat exchanger, which transfers the heat into the water of a building's heating system. After the heat is removed, the cooler water is pumped back down into the Earth through a second well.

One of the great things about geothermal energy is that it provides heat constantly, even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. The Earth produces heat all day, every day of the year! And best of all, once the wells are drilled, geothermal energy does not create any greenhouse gas emissions or other pollution.

Geothermal energy is used most places where there are hot springs or geysers, like Iceland or Yellowstone National Park. But new technologies are making it possible to access geothermal heat almost anywhere by drilling much deeper wells. There are now geothermal heating systems in all 50 U.S. states!

One geothermal heating system can provide heat for many buildings. Colleges and university campuses are ideal places for geothermal systems because they have lots of buildings close together needing heating and cooling. For example, Ball State University in Indiana heats and cools over 4 million square feet of building space using geothermal energy from about 700 wells on campus!

Geothermal energy can also be used to generate electricity. Hot water from geothermal reservoirs can drive turbine generators just like steam from burning coal or natural gas does. Countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Iceland get up to 25% of their electricity from geothermal power plants!

As fossil fuels continue to get used up, we need to tap into renewable energy sources like geothermal more and more. The Earth has an enormous amount of heat energy available to us - we just need to drill down and tap into it! So next time you're sitting by a cozy fire or in a warm building, think about the secret heating system under your feet bringing you geothermal energy!
