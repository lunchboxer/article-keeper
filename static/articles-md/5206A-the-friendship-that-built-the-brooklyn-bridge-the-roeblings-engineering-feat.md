# The Friendship That Built the Brooklyn Bridge: The Roeblings' Engineering Feat

The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in the world. It connects the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. But do you know the story behind how it was built? The Brooklyn Bridge was designed by John A. Roebling. He was an engineer who had built many suspension bridges already. In 1869, Roebling began working on plans for the Brooklyn Bridge. He wanted to build the largest suspension bridge in the world. However, Roebling suffered a terrible accident while surveying the bridge site. A ferry crushed his foot and he passed away from tetanus soon after.

Roebling’s son, Washington Roebling, took over the monumental project. Washington had helped his father with bridges before. But not long after starting work on the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington got decompression sickness. This illness occurs when you come up from deep water too fast. It is also called “the bends”. The bends made Washington very sick. He was bedridden for the rest of the project. Even though he was sick, Washington still managed the whole bridge construction. He watched the work through a telescope from his bedroom. His wife Emily helped too. She learned engineering on the job. Emily passed messages between workers and her husband. She made many big decisions herself. The Roeblings worked as a team even when they couldn’t be together on site.

It took 14 years for workers to finish the Brooklyn Bridge. When it opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was a marvel of engineering. At the time, its main span was the longest in the world. It was 50% longer than any other suspension bridge. The bridge towers were made of granite, limestone, and cement. Huge cables held up the weight of the bridge deck and vehicles. When it opened, people worried the Brooklyn Bridge might collapse. So, P.T. Barnum led a parade of 21 elephants over the bridge to prove it was safe! The Brooklyn Bridge has stood strong for over 100 years. Today, it carries trains, cars, bikers, and pedestrians between boroughs. The Roeblings built more than a bridge. With teamwork and determination, they connected two great cities.
