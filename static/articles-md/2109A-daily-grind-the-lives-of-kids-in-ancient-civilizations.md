# Daily grind: The lives of kids in ancient civilizations

Hey kids! Have you ever wondered what life was like for other kids a long, long time ago? Well buckle up, because we're about to take a trip back in time to learn all about it!

In the ancient world, most kids didn't go to school like you. Nope, they started working and learning family trades as young as 5 or 6 years old! Girls learned skills like cooking, cleaning, sewing and weaving from their moms. Boys hunted and farmed alongside their dads. Talk about no summer vacation!

Farm kids woke up extra early to start chores before the sun came up. They fed animals, collected eggs, and brought water from wells. After a quick breakfast, it was out to the fields to plant, tend, and harvest crops. Tough work for little hands! At lunch time, they scarfed down cheese, nuts, veggies and porridge to refuel.

Not all ancient kids were peasants and farmers though. In cities like Rome, Greece and Egypt, richer kids had tutors for school. They studied reading, math, music, grammar, and public speaking. Nobles and pharaohs sent their kids to train at temples too. But when lessons were done, these kids still had music and sports to practice, on top of helping at home. No lounging around for upper class youngsters!

Leisure time was rare for ancient youth. Crafts, board games, playing with pets or toys, and local festivals were the most common ways to relax. Horseback riding, swimming, hunting, wrestling and ball games like juggling, catch, and soccer were athletic pastimes. Ancient kids had games too, like Blind Man’s Bluff, Tag, Hide and Seek, and Hopscotch. Not too different from your playground favorites!

Chores, school, work, all that responsibility - what about playtime you ask? Well, dolls, toy chariots and carts, spinning tops, balls and stick games were popular playthings. Kids loved animals and owned pets like dogs, birds, gazelles, monkeys and lambs. Going to the zoo meant checking out ostrich rodeos, hippo wrangling, or elephant events at amphitheaters! Beats going to the circus.

As for food, kids couldn’t grab sugary snacks and sodas from the pantry. Fruits like figs, dates, pomegranates, and nuts were typical treats. Olives and goat cheese provided savory bite. Soups and stews with lentils, beans, veggies, or barley filled hungry tummies. And for feasts, roasted oxen or goose were served! Mmm, pass the baklava for dessert.

Camping in ancient days meant sleeping under the stars on long trade routes, military conquests, or religious pilgrimages. Imagine “glamping” with goat-hair tents and campfires, but no mattresses or flashlights! Soldiers, explorers and travelers journeyed for months, facing fierce weather and bandits. Talk about a rough field trip.

Though daily life was hard for ancient youth, it wasn’t all work and no play. Kids found ways to have fun with simple toys and games, whenever a break from tasks allowed. And while school, chores and jobs kept idle hands busy, family provided community and purpose. So the next time you don’t feel like doing homework or cleaning your room, think of how kids survived and thrived thousands of years ago! Hope you enjoyed this adventure way back in time!
