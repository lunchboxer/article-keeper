# Weird and Wonderful Art Supplies You've Never Heard Of

Hey kids! Have you ever gotten bored using the same old crayons, markers, and paint? Well, there are tons of weird and wacky art supplies out there that you've probably never heard of! Keep reading to learn about some of the strangest art materials that will make your art projects way more fun and interesting.

## Coffee

That's right - some artists use coffee as a painting material! The brown tones of coffee can add warmth and depth to paintings. To use it, simply brew some coffee and let it cool. Then grab a paintbrush and start creating! The coffee will dry and stain the paper. You can experiment by making the coffee lighter or darker to get different shades. Who needs boring brown paint when you can use yummy coffee instead?

## Metal

Metal is not just for sculptures! Some artists paint with metal flakes or powdered metal pigments to give their art a cool, shiny metallic look. Different metals like copper, bronze, and aluminum create different colored metallic effects when used in paint. Try mixing metal paints with regular paints to get a fun glimmering, glittery result.

## Dirt

Mother Nature provides some of the best art supplies. Plain old dirt from your backyard can be used to create stunning earthy art. Some artists use dirt directly by grabbing handfuls and smearing it on paper. Others mix it with paint or glue to get different textures and shades. If you don't want to get too messy, try collecting dirt from different places and putting it in jars to use. Get creative with nature's art supplies!

## Twigs

Along with dirt, twigs picked up from the ground can add natural beauty to art. Arrange and glue down a bunch of twigs to make a cool textured background for a painting. Or, paint designs and patterns directly onto individual twigs to make them into one-of-a-kind paint brushes! You can also use twigs to dip into paint and make prints. They create perfect thin lines and swooping curves.

## Ketchup

Here's a condiment you won't find on any paint store shelf - ketchup! The red sauce makes a fun alternative to red paint. Squeeze it directly onto paper from the bottle or mix it with other paint colors to create new shades. It has a smooth, glossy texture when dried. Drizzle or splatter ketchup across your art to add excitement!
