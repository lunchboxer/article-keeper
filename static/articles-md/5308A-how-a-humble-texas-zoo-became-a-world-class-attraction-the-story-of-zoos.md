# How a Humble Texas Zoo Became a World-Class Attraction: The Story of Zoos

Not too long ago, the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas was a small operation. It had only a handful of animals and not too many visitors. But over the past few decades it has grown into one of the best zoos in the whole world! This is the amazing tale of how a tiny zoo in the Lone Star State became a world-famous attraction.

Back in the 1960s, the Fort Worth Zoo was dinky. It had no more than 10 exhibits and just a few hundred animals. Most folks in Fort Worth didn't even know it existed! The zoo didn't have much money for new exhibits or animals. But in the early 1970s, things started to change. A new director named Rick Barongi took over. He wanted to make the Fort Worth Zoo into a world-class operation.

Barongi started getting more funding from the city. He used the money to build exciting new exhibits like an African Savannah habitat. For the first time, the zoo had rhinos, zebras, lions and other amazing African wildlife all in one huge outdoor space. Visitors loved walking through and seeing the animals up close!

The new exhibits were a big success. More and more people started coming to the zoo. By the late 1970s, attendance had doubled from just a few years before. With more visitors, the zoo made more money to invest in new habitats and animals. They built a tropical rainforest pavilion and a new area for Asian elephants. The Fort Worth Zoo was on its way to becoming a Lone Star legend!

In the 1980s and 90s, the zoo just kept growing. They added lots more species like giraffes, gorillas and chimpanzees. One of the most popular new exhibits was the Texas Wild! section. It has armadillos, longhorns, prairie dogs and other Texan critters. By the year 2000, the Fort Worth Zoo had over 5,000 animals from all around the globe. From humble beginnings, it had become a world-class zoo.

These days, the Fort Worth Zoo has over 500 animal species and sees over a million visitors annually. It has kayak tours, a carousel, a train and fun rides. Yet it stays true to its Texan roots. For a one-of-a-kind wildlife adventure in the Lone Star State, the Fort Worth Zoo is a must-visit attraction!
