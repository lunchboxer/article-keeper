# Disasters and Danger: Moving to Avoid Catastrophe

Natural disasters can strike anywhere at any time. From hurricanes to tornadoes, floods to earthquakes, some places are more prone to catastrophic events than others. Knowing the risks where you live, and taking steps to get out of harm's way, can help keep your family safe.

## Where Disasters Happen

Different parts of the world are prone to different natural disasters. In the southeastern United States, hurricanes are a major threat. The coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean get hit by strong tropical storms each year between June and November. Further inland, tornadoes rip through Tornado Alley states like Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas when conditions are right.

In California, earthquakes are always a danger as the state sits on the San Andreas Fault. When two pieces of the earth's crust slip past each other, it can trigger a quake. Flooding happens often in low-lying states like Florida and Louisiana. Heavy rains quickly overwhelm rivers and flood towns and cities.  

Disasters don't just happen in the U.S. Typhoons, which are the same as hurricanes, frequently strike countries in Southeast Asia. Japan's position on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire makes it prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. No place is completely safe from the possibility of a natural catastrophe.

## Heading for Higher Ground

When people learn that the place they call home has higher risks for certain disasters, some make the decision to move to safer areas. For example, after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, the city lost over 100,000 residents who chose to relocate.

Others take preparations like elevating their houses or reinforcing walls and roofs to withstand hurricane-force winds and storm surge flooding. In earthquake zones, securing bookcases, water heaters, and other household items can reduce damage and injuries when the ground shakes. Being aware of local dangers makes it easier to take action to stay safe.

## Watching the Weather

Advancements in weather tracking and forecasting have given people more time to get out of the way of storms. Meteorologists can now see hurricanes forming over the ocean many days in advance with satellites. Warnings go out when tornadoes are possible so people can take shelter. Flood and tsunami warnings alerts citizens to head to higher ground.

While we can never fully prevent natural disasters, modern technology helps reduce risks. Paying attention to local weather reports and emergency broadcasts can make the difference between life and death. Heeding calls to evacuate or take cover keeps more people safer when catastrophe strikes.
