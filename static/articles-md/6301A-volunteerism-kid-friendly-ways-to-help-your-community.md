# Volunteerism - Kid-friendly ways to help your community

Hey kids! Do you want to make a difference in your neighborhood? Volunteering is a great way to help people in need. And guess what? You're never too young to volunteer. There are tons of ways kids just like you can pitch in to make your community a little better.

Let's start with animals. Lots of animal shelters need volunteers to help take care of rescue dogs and cats. You could walk dogs, give them baths, brush their fur, or even read to them! Shelters also need help cleaning cages and feeding the animals. If you're an animal lover, this is a paw-some way to volunteer.

Another way to help animals and people is by volunteering at a local food bank. Food banks collect food and deliver it to people in need. You could help sort cans, pack boxes, or hand out food. With so many people hurting for food right now, food banks really need kid power!

If you like gardening, think about volunteering at a community garden. You could plant seeds, pull weeds, water plants, and more. Many neighborhoods have community gardens where people can grow fruits and veggies. Lending a hand will help feed families healthy food.

Want to help the environment? Look for litter clean-up events happening near you. Grabbing a trash bag and gloves to pick up litter is an easy way to make your town look nicer. You’ll be shocked by how much trash you can find at parks, beaches, rivers, and roads. Do your part by cleaning it up.

Are you crafty? Volunteer at a senior center to make cards and crafts with the elderly. Older adults would love your company and creativity. Bring supplies to make cards for holidays and birthdays. Or get a group together to paint ceramics or do a craft activity with seniors. They’ll think you’re pretty hip!

Last but not least, volunteering at a food kitchen, shelter, or community event is a great way for kids to help. You could serve food, hand out blankets, or register people at local 5Ks and festivals. Any time an extra hand is needed, you can be there to chip in.

Volunteering as a kid is fun, easy, and so rewarding. Find an opportunity that fits your interests and schedule. Gather some friends to join you if you can. Remember that any act of service, big or small, can make a difference. Now get out there and do good!
