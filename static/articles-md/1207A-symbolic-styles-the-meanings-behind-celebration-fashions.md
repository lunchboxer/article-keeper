# Symbolic Styles: The Meanings Behind Celebration Fashions

Hey kids! Have you ever wondered why people wear certain clothes for different holidays and celebrations? The outfits we choose for events like Halloween, weddings, and more all have special meanings. Keep reading to uncover the stories behind these symbolic styles!

On Halloween, witches wear pointy black hats. Legend says that during medieval times, wise women called witches used to brew potions to help sick people in tall, pointy hats. Their tall hats allowed them to concentrate while working. When people became scared of witchcraft, the pointy hat became a symbol of something spooky. Now every Halloween, witches wear special black pointy hats as part of their costume. 

Brides wear long white wedding gowns. Hundreds of years ago, wealthy brides would wear elaborate dresses in their favorite colors, like blue or pink. But Queen Victoria of England started a new trend in 1840 when she wore a stunning white gown on her wedding day. White symbolized purity and innocence. Ever since, white wedding gowns have been popular around the world. They represent the joy and beauty of marriage.

On St. Patrick's Day, people wear green. St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, and the color green represents Ireland. It was said that St. Patrick used the three-leaf shamrock plant to describe the idea of the Trinity. Green shamrocks have become a symbol of St. Patrick's Day celebrations worldwide. Many people also wear green on March 17 to show honor for Irish culture. It's the official national color of Ireland.

The sparkly top hat is a sign of a magician. Legend has it that magicians started wearing top hats in the 1700s. Back then, magicians would use magic wands to make animals seem to disappear and reappear. The tall black hat drew people's attention upwards to the magic trick, rather than downwards where the animals were hidden. Today, the glittery top hat remains a mysterious symbol of magic acts and illusions.

So the next time you dress up for a holiday or celebration, think about the story behind the styles. Clothes can have rich histories and symbolic meanings that make events even more fun!
