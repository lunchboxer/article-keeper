# The Humble Origins of McDonald's: How the Fast Food Giant Got Its Start

McDonald's is one of the biggest and most famous fast food chains in the world today. But it wasn't always that way. McDonald's started out as just a small restaurant in California run by two brothers named **Richard** and **Maurice McDonald**.

Back in the 1930s, the McDonald brothers opened up a hot dog stand in Pasadena, California. At first, their little hot dog stand didn't make much money. But the brothers were determined to find a way to make their restaurant successful.

In 1948, the McDonald brothers decided to close down their hot dog stand and reopen as a hamburger restaurant. Their new restaurant was called McDonald's Famous Barbecue. At this new McDonald's, the brothers realized that most of their sales came from hamburgers and fries. So they simplified the menu to focus just on burgers, fries, sodas, and shakes.

The McDonald brothers also figured out ways to make food fast. They designed their kitchen to cook burgers very quickly using an assembly line method. Their restaurant had no servers or waiters. People ordered their food at a counter, got their meal in a paper bag, and found their own seat in the restaurant. This sped everything up.

With its fast service and yummy cheap hamburgers, the new McDonald's restaurant was a big success. But it was still just one small restaurant in California. That changed in 1954 when a man named **Ray Kroc** visited the McDonald's restaurant. He was amazed by its efficient operations and good food. Soon afterward, Ray Kroc made a deal with the McDonald brothers to franchise the McDonald's brand and open more McDonald's locations all over the U.S.

Ray Kroc helped turn McDonald's into a giant, international company. By 1958, McDonald's had sold over 100 million hamburgers! The company grew faster than anyone could have imagined. Today there are over 38,000 McDonald's locations all over the world in more than 100 countries. And McDonald's sells billions of burgers every year.

When you visit a McDonald's today, you can see that it still uses many of the original ideas from the very first McDonald's back in the 1940s. The food is cooked quickly and served fast. Customers still order at a counter and find their own seat. And the menu still focuses on burgers, fries, sodas, and shakes - the delicious fast food classics that first made McDonald's so popular.

So the next time you're eating a Big Mac and fries, remember the humble beginnings of McDonald's as a small hamburger stand in California. The speedy service and yummy food that you enjoy today is thanks to the innovative ideas of the McDonald brothers back when they first got their restaurant started over 70 years ago!
