# Hunger - Why food insecurity still plagues populations

Many people around the world do not have enough good food to eat. This is called **food insecurity**. Around 10 out of every 100 people have this problem. That's more than 800 million people without enough food!

Why does food insecurity happen? There are many reasons. One big reason is **poverty**. People living in poverty do not have enough money to buy or grow food. Many places in Africa and Asia are very poor. Even in rich countries like the U.S., 1 out of 10 families with kids don't have enough food.

**Bad weather** also makes food insecurity worse. Droughts, floods, and storms can ruin crops and stop food from being transported. As climate change gets worse, bad weather will happen more often.

**War** is another cause. Fighting damages farms and food systems. Sometimes warring groups even use hunger as a weapon. They stop food aid or block trade. Places with long wars like South Sudan, Yemen, and Syria have very high malnutrition.

**Poor infrastructure** and technology are other problems. Many small farms in poor countries lack irrigation, fertilizer, or good equipment. This makes growing enough food hard. Bad roads and lack of refrigeration also make moving and storing food difficult.

**Illnesses** like HIV/AIDS and parasites can make malnutrition worse by making it hard to absorb nutrients. Animal and crop diseases can also destroy food sources.

But there is hope! New farming tools like hydroponics and vertical farming allow food to be grown anywhere. Special crop varieties help farmers deal with droughts and pests. Many countries give food aid and nutrition programs. You can help by donating to responsible aid groups. If we keep trying, someday no one will have to be hungry.
