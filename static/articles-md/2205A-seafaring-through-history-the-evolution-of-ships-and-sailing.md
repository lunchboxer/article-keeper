# Seafaring through history: The evolution of ships and sailing

For thousands of years, people have been sailing the seas in ships. Early ships were very simple, but over time they became more advanced. Keep reading to learn about how ships and sailing have changed throughout history!

In ancient times, the first boats were little more than floating logs or bundles of reeds. People used them mainly to cross rivers or travel short distances near the shore. Around 3,000 BC, ancient Egyptians started building wooden sailboats. The sails let them use the wind to go farther and faster. Their boats had a mast to hold the sail up and a keel to help them steer.

By 2,000 BC, Phoenicians had created the first real warships called galleys. Galleys had sails and oars, so they could keep moving even when there was no wind. The Phoenicians used galleys to explore, trade, and even battle other ships. Through the Middle Ages, galleys continued to carry soldiers into naval battles.

In the 1400s, Europeans started sailing across oceans to reach new lands. They needed bigger, stronger ships for long voyages. In the 1500s, the Spanish built galleons. Galleons had up to three decks for cannons and could hold more cargo. Their designs let them sail great distances across rough seas.

The 1600s brought even bigger changes. The British developed faster, more stable ships called frigates. Unlike bulky galleons, frigates had a sleek shape that sliced through waves. Around this time, merchants also began using clipper ships that had tall masts and many sails. Clippers were extremely swift, breaking speed records as they hauled goods around the world.

Steam power revolutionized seafaring in the 1800s. Steamships had engines and propellers to move them instead of just sails. The SS Great Britain, built in 1843, was the first big ocean-going steamship. Steam engines let large steel ships carry more goods and people than ever before.

In the early 1900s, oil replaced steam as the main power source for ships. Massive oil-driven ships like ocean liners and aircraft carriers dominated the seas through World War II. Today, most large ships run on oil or diesel fuel. However, new technologies like solar, wind, and hydrogen power are now being used for cleaner, greener sailing!

Over thousands of years, ships have gone from small reed rafts to enormous cruise ships and cargo freighters. Sails gave way to steam, then oil and diesel. Through it all, our skill at seafaring has expanded trade, exploration, and warfare around the globe. What exciting changes will the future of sailing hold? Keep your eyes on the horizon to find out!
