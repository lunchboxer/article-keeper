# Secrets of the scrolls: Exploring ancient Roman literature

A long time ago, before books and computers, the ancient Romans wrote down their stories and ideas on scrolls. Scroll were made out of a material called papyrus. Papyrus was made from a tall plant that grew near the Nile River in Egypt.

Scrolls looked like rolled up posters. To read a scroll, you had to carefully unroll it from top to bottom. Some scrolls were over 30 feet long!

The Romans wrote all sorts of things on their scrolls - poetry, history, science, and even recipes! Many ancient Roman scrolls have been lost over time. But archaeologists are still digging up new ones. What cool secrets might these old scrolls hold? Let's take a peek at the mysterious world of ancient Roman writing!

## Exciting Hero Stories

The Romans loved epic hero tales like the Greek myths about Odysseus and Achilles. Roman writers created their own hero - Aeneas. He escaped from Troy after it burned down in the Trojan War. A famous Roman poem called the "Aeneid" tells how Aeneas journeyed to Italy where he became an ancestor of the Romans.

The Romans also wrote down many Greek myths. In the myth "Orpheus and Eurydice", Orpheus goes to the underworld to rescue his bride Eurydice after a snake bite kills her right after their wedding! Uh oh - things don't end well for the loving couple. The Roman version of this sad tale inspired paintings, poems, and operas for centuries.

## Histories About Rome

Roman historians also wrote important books to explain how Rome grew from a small town into a mighty civilization. One famous Roman historian named Tacitus wrote histories called the "Annals" and the "Histories." These exciting histories described the dramatic lives of Rome's leaders - the emperors!

From Augustus, Rome's first emperor, to the wacky Caligula who told his soldiers to collect seashells as "prizes of war", Tacitus revealed juicy details and gossip about the rulers. It's like reading about a modern-day royal family!

## Science for Farming...and Fighting

While Roman poetry and history texts are interesting, practical science writing was also important. For instance, Roman authors wrote farming guides with tips for growing olives, grapes, and grains. With volcanoes erupting nearby, Romans had to get creative to grow enough food!

Military science was also key. Roman army engineers wrote manuals on catapults and other siege weapons used to attack enemy cities. They used these contraptions to hurl giant boulders to smash down walls and gates.

Roman military manuals even had recipes for nasty poisons! Dropped into enemy water supplies, these toxins brought slow, painful deaths. Ancient Roman warfare was definitely not for the fainthearted.

## What Other Secrets Lie Hidden?

For centuries, scholars have treasured the literary treasures of Rome. But many ancient scrolls still remain buried and hidden away. As archaeologists keep digging up lost Roman texts, who knows what other adventures, myths, histories, or secrets we may uncover? The next great Roman work could be unearthed at any moment!
