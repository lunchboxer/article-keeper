# Saving Resources - Ways to conserve energy and materials

Saving our planet is important! There are many ways kids can help use less energy and stuff. This protects Earth's resources and environment. Try these eco-friendly tips!

When you leave a room, turn off the lights. Electricity comes from power plants that burn fuel. Using less saves energy because less fuel is burned. At night, use dimmer switches or small nightlights instead of big bright lights.

While brushing your teeth, turn off the water faucet. Letting the water run wastes gallons every minute! Take faster showers too. You can get clean in 5 minutes, not 20. Small changes add up to big water savings over time.

Recycle paper, plastic, glass and cans. Making new things from recycled stuff reduces trash. It also saves more resources than making new things. Bonus: Recycling keeps landfills from getting too full too fast.

Use reusable bags and water bottles. They make less waste than disposable ones. Pack lunch in reusable containers too. Less garbage is better for the planet.

Unplug chargers when not in use. Many chargers use energy even with nothing plugged in. Unplugging them stops the energy waste. Your parents will like saving electricity too!

Turn off computers and game systems when you're not playing. Like chargers, their standby power uses electricity. Shutting down completely reduces wasted energy.

There you go - six eco-friendly tips to use less energy and stuff. Small steps lead to big change. Get your family to join you in saving resources. Protecting Earth starts at home. Let's all help take care of the planet!
