# Art That Speaks Up for People and the Planet

Art can be a powerful way to speak up about things that matter to people and the planet. More and more artists today are using their art to get people talking about big issues. Their art is about topics like the environment, being poor, war, and human rights. The artists want to move and push people to take action through their creative works.

One artist who does this is John Quigley. He makes giant paintings on the ground called “spectacle art.” In 2005, Quigley made a huge portrait of a man’s face on the ground in Chicago. The man was Morrison Waite. Waite was an important judge who stood up for the rights of Native Americans long ago. With his bigger-than-life portrait, Quigley hoped to promote tolerance and diversity.

Another earthwork artist with a message is Daniel Dancer. He designs beautiful spirals and patterns using stuff from nature. Dancer gathers things like flower petals and pine cones and carefully places them to make cool shapes. His artworks celebrate the beauty of the Earth. But they also raise awareness about how people’s actions can hurt the environment.

Some street artists use graffiti to speak out on social issues. A man calling himself Bansky has become famous for his graffiti art with political messages. Banksy’s funny street art pops up in public places, from building walls to zoos to museums. His humorous works highlight issues like war, being poor and differences between rich and poor people.

Another street artist named JR specializes in gigantic portraits of regular people. JR posts these larger-than-life pictures on buildings, walls, rooftops, and bridges around the world. His goal is to call attention to people who often get overlooked. In 2008, he transformed a Rio de Janeiro slum by plastering huge photos of residents onto its shanties. This celebrated the dignity of the poor community.

Many artists have turned to creating powerful posters with bold graphics and slogans. They print copies to put up across cities or hand out at rallies and protests. Their artistic posters speak out on all kinds of causes, from climate change to human rights struggles.

One example is Ernesto Yerena, a Chicano artist and activist in Los Angeles. He makes highly symbolic posters addressing immigrant rights. His works combine skeletons, indigenous imagery, and bold phrases. Yerena prints posters for marches and hands them out in his community to raise awareness.

The famous graphic designer Milton Glaser also created a poster that became a symbol for unity. In 1975, New York City was going broke. Glaser designed a poster with the slogan “I ♥ NY” inside a red heart. This poster grew into an iconic image to show pride in New York. It still appears in gift shops today!

Artists play an important role as voices for the voiceless. Their art provides a powerful way to creatively communicate messages. As these examples show, art can speak volumes in support of people, communities, and causes around the world!
