# Being a Changemaker - Kids who changed the world and how you can too

Do you want to make the world better? Some kids have done amazing things to help people and the planet. You can be a changemaker too!

Greta Thunberg started a big movement about climate change. When she was 15, she protested alone outside the government building in Sweden. She held a sign that said “School Strike for Climate.” Greta skipped school on Fridays to protest. Soon, kids around the world skipped school on Fridays to ask leaders to fix climate change. Greta showed that one person can start a big movement.

Ryan Hickman started recycling cardboard at age 3. By age 5, he recycled over 200,000 cans and bottles! Ryan uses the money to donate toys and food to people in need. He also gives talks to get kids excited about recycling. Ryan shows you’re never too young to make a change.

When Vivian Lord was 6, she got upset seeing homeless people. She decided to build tiny houses for them. Vivian raised money by making bracelets and lemonade. She built 12 tiny houses with over $16,000! Vivian shows small acts of kindness can go a long way.

So how can you cause change? Follow your passion! What problems do you want to solve? Homelessness, hunger, pollution? Start small. Have a bake sale or wash cars to raise money. Volunteer at a food bank or animal shelter. Clean up trash in your area.

Invent something new to help people or the planet. Or start a school club to spread awareness. Make videos, art, or write letters about issues you care about.

Most importantly, don’t give up if you hit bumps. Real change takes time. Stay positive and try new ideas. The best changemakers are creative, brave, and determined. They believe in themselves and inspire others.

No matter your age or skills, you can improve the world. Follow your dreams to cause change. The future depends on kids like you!
