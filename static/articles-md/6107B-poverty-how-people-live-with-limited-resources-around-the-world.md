# Poverty - How People Live with Limited Resources around the World

What does it mean to be poor? Being poor means not having enough money to buy the things you need, like food, a home, or doctors. Many families around the world are poor. Life can be hard when you are poor, but people find ways to take care of each other.

In some parts of Africa, small towns work together. They build houses out of mud and straw. Women and girls walk miles every day to get water for their families. They carry the heavy water buckets balanced on their heads! Kids often can't go to school because their families need help at home. There are not a lot of jobs or money.

In big cities like Mumbai, India, millions of people live in crowded shantytowns made of scrap metal and plastic. Whole families live in tiny one-room shacks. When it rains, the roofs leak. There is no clean water or electricity. Parents take any job they can find, like picking up trash or making bricks. Kids as young as five or six work too. They sell flowers or beg for change instead of going to school.

In rural villages in China, some kids stay behind when their parents move to cities to find jobs. These "left-behind children" must take care of themselves without their parents. They cook food, care for farm animals, and grow vegetables to eat. Even though it's hard without their mom and dad, the kids find ways to stick together and survive.

No matter where they live, people who are poor are very resourceful. They work very hard every day just to buy food and shelter. Even when they are hungry or sick, they do not lose hope for a better life.
