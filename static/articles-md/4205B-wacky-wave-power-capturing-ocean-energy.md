# Wacky wave power: Capturing ocean energy

The ocean is so powerful! Waves crash. Tides rise and fall. Currents whoosh through the water. All that motion contains energy that we can use. Capturing the ocean's energy to make electricity is called wave power.

Wave power devices are like the ocean's helpers. They collect energy from the moving water. Then they change that energy into electricity that powers our homes, schools, and businesses. Isn't that fin-tastic?

One type of wave power device is called a point absorber. It's a giant floating buoy that bobs up and down as waves pass by. The bobbing motion runs a generator inside the buoy. The generator changes the energy from the waves into electricity. Point absorbers are simple and cheap to build. But they don't make as much power as other devices.

Another device is an oscillating water column. It's a tall hollow tube made of concrete or steel. Waves push air in and out of the open bottom of the tube as they pass by. The moving air spins a turbine connected to a generator to make electricity! Oscillating water columns can capture energy from waves coming from all directions.

Some wave power devices are super silly looking! One wild design is made of long floating tubes linked together like a snake. As waves cause the tubes to bend back and forth, they use the motion to push water through a turbine. Even though it looks wacky, it works!

Wave power is so cool because it uses the endless motion of the ocean. Waves, tides and currents will keep going forever. That means wave power is renewable. It will never run out! Using the power of the sea is a splash-tastic way to make clean energy without pollution. Let's make a wave!
