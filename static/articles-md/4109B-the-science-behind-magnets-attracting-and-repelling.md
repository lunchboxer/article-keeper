# The science behind magnets attracting and repelling

Magnets are so fun to play with! Some magnets stick together while others push away. Why does this happen? Let's learn about what makes magnets work their magic!

Magnets are made of special materials, like iron, nickel, and cobalt. These are called ferromagnetic materials. Inside these are tons of tiny atoms. Atoms are the basic building blocks of everything! At the center of each atom is a nucleus. Around the nucleus spin electrons.

The electrons act like mini magnets. They each have their own little magnetic field. In most stuff, the electron fields point every which way. But in magnet materials, the fields line up! This makes a strong magnetic field to turn the material into a magnet.

When you bring magnets close, their fields connect. Opposite poles stick, same poles repel! A magnet's north pole field points north. Its south pole field points south. Opposite fields pull together. Same fields push apart.

Opposite poles have fields that attract. Trying to pull them apart is hard! Their power grips tight. Bring same poles near and their fields hit. They push back and bounce away! Do it again, same thing happens - they just won't stick!

Magnets do so many cool things. They stick notes on fridges and keep headphones snug. Magnets make bracelets that snap together in a flash. Strong magnets even help run motors and make power. MRIs use huge magnets to see inside you!

So next time you feel magnets pull or push, think of their invisible fields! Science makes magnets seem like magic. But it's all about forces between atoms' electrons. Pretty neat!

## Glossary

- atom - The basic pieces that everything is made of. Atoms have a nucleus with electrons spinning around it.
- electron - A negatively charged particle spinning around an atom's nucleus. Electron motions make magnetic fields.
- magnetic field - The area around a magnet where its force works. Magnetic fields push or pull other magnets.
- nucleus - The center or core of an atom, containing protons and neutrons.
- repel - To push away from something. Magnets repel when their fields collide and push back.
