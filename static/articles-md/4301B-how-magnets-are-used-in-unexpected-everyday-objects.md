# How magnets are used in unexpected everyday objects

Magnets are so cool! You probably have some stickers or art stuck to your fridge thanks to tiny magnets. But did you know magnets are hiding in tons of other stuff too? From your toys to planes, magnets help make things work in ways you might not realize. Let's explore some of the sneaky spots magnets are hiding in!

Your microwave has magnets inside called magnetrons. When you zap your food, these magnets spin really fast. Their spinning creates invisible waves called microwaves that heat up your meal. No magnets means no yummy noodles in 60 seconds!

Roller coasters have magnets too! Sensors along the tracks can tell exactly where the ride cart is. The sensors turn magnets on or off at the perfect times to help slow the cart down a bit. This makes the ride safer, but still super fun!

Electric guitars and keyboards use magnets to make music! Under each guitar string is a magnet. When the strings vibrate, the magnets turn those vibrations into electric signals. Those signals get amped up to make awesome guitar sounds! Keyboards have magnets under the keys to know when you press them.

Magnets help you get around too! Special magnet ink is used to store info on subway and bus cards. The card's magnets let you swipe through the turnstile. Compasses have a small magnet that always points north, so you know which way to walk. Some really fast trains called maglev trains float on magnets above the tracks!

Even little fitness trackers have tiny magnets inside. When you move, the magnets spin and send signals about your steps and how fast you're going. The magnets help motivate you to stay active!

Doctors use huge magnets called MRI machines to see inside people's bodies and help figure out if someone is sick or hurt. And spacecraft like Voyager 1 have magnetometers to study magnetic fields in outer space!

As you can see, magnets are so much more amazing than just sticking stuff to your fridge! They make our lives better in all kinds of ways. Keep your eyes open for magnets at work all around you!
