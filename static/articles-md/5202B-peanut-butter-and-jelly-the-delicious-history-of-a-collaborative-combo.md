Peanut butter is very old. Long ago, ancient people called the Incas in South America were the first to crush peanuts into paste. In the late 1800s, peanut butter started getting popular in America. Health experts said it was nutritious and good for protein.

The timing was just right. A doctor named George Washington Carver had just found hundreds of uses for peanuts. He made recipes for peanut cookies, ice cream, and peanut butter. Peanut butter quickly became a kitchen staple all over the United States.

Around the same time, fruit spreads like jelly were getting popular too. New ways to process food let jams and jellies be made in factories. By the 1920s, big brands like Welch's and Smucker's were selling lots of jelly in jars.

Even though peanut butter and jelly had both been around for many years, it wasn't until the 1920s that people started mixing them together. Recipes for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches started showing up in cookbooks in the late 1920s. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches got even more popular. They were an inexpensive, filling food when times were tough.

Soldiers fighting in World War II also fueled the craze for peanut butter and jelly. The army served peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because they were easy to carry and didn't spoil. When soldiers came home after the war, they helped make the sandwich famous across the country.

The 1950s made peanut butter and jelly an American favorite. Regular people and celebrities loved the simple but delicious combo. Elvis Presley really liked fried peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. In fact, he once flew on his private airplane across the whole country just to eat one!

Today, Americans eat more than $800 million worth of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every year. From lunchboxes to late night snacks, peanut butter and jelly stays a tasty tradition passed down through generations. Who knew peanuts and fruit could go so perfectly between two slices of bread? The special mix of peanut butter and jelly shows how great things can happen when two good foods join together.
