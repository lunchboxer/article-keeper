# Strange sources of renewable energy

Have you ever thought about where we get energy from? Many people think of coal, oil, natural gas, wind, or solar power. But there are some very unusual renewable energy sources that scientists are exploring!

One strange energy source is pee! Scientists are figuring out how to get electricity from urine. It sounds gross, but it could be very useful. Urine contains nutrients that fuel bacteria. The bacteria can make enough power to light up a small LED lightbulb. Someday public bathrooms may be able to light themselves with pee power!

Another odd energy source is dance floors. When people dance, they make vibrations with their feet. Under dance floors, special pads can turn those vibrations into a tiny bit of electricity. One famous club in London powers its entire building this way! Every night when people dance, they are creating green power.

Sweat is smelly, but it can also make energy. Scientists are creating clothes that harvest the sweat from your armpits when you exercise. The clothes have special fibers that act like solar cells to turn sweat into a tiny electric current. Don't throw away those smelly gym clothes - they might be fueling the future!

Rotting fruit could also provide renewable power. Fruit releases small traces of electricity as it decomposes. Scientists are working on "bacterial batteries" that trap this energy. They hope to use these batteries in poor rural areas. Farmers could gather old fruit scraps and turn them into free electricity.

Some researchers are even looking at energy from seashells andlobster shells. The hard outer shells contain minerals that produce electricity when pressed. A company is testing ways to harvest shell waste from seafood restaurants. Those crab cake leftovers could end up lighting someone's home!

Next time you think you're all out of energy, remember planet Earth still has some unusual sources to tap into. With a little innovation, your dance moves, sweaty gym socks, and even bathroom breaks could end up fueling the world!
