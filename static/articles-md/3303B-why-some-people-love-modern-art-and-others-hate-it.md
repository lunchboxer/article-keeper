# Why Some People Love Modern Art and Others Hate It

Art is something that makes us feel all kinds of emotions. When you go to a museum, you might see paintings and sculptures that look weird. Some of them might look like a kid made them! This is called modern art. People feel differently about modern art. Some people love how creative it is. Others don’t get it at all. They think it’s silly. In this article, we’ll learn why modern art makes some people happy and others confused.

A long time ago, around the 1800s, artists got bored painting in the old styles. Back then, most art tried to show real people and places. But some artists like Picasso wanted to show feelings instead. They used bright, fun colors and shapes. Their paintings didn’t try to look real.

People who enjoy modern art say it makes them feel emotions. The colors and shapes show feelings you can’t put into words. Modern art is very creative. No two modern artworks look the same. People who like modern art see things in it that others don’t. They use their imagination when they look at it.

But some people don’t like modern art. To them, it looks messy and sloppy. They think real art should show real stuff, like people and places. Modern abstract art doesn’t do that. Some people think modern art takes no skill to make. They don’t think throwing paint on a canvas is art.

So who is right? Maybe there’s no right or wrong opinion when it comes to art. What looks bad to one person can look creative to someone else. Something one person doesn’t understand might have meaning to someone else. Everyone can have their own opinion.

Here’s another reason people have different opinions on modern art. When it first appeared, people were shocked. Old art tried to look very realistic. Picasso's paintings looked weird and messy to them. It took time for people to appreciate modern art.

Today, many people still don’t like modern art. When a messy modern painting sells for millions of dollars, some get mad. But for fans, abstract art has emotions you can’t put a price on.

Next time you go to an art museum, keep an open mind about modern art. Spend time looking at it. Use your imagination. You might start to like it! Or you might still think it’s silly. That’s okay too. The most important thing is to make up your own mind!
