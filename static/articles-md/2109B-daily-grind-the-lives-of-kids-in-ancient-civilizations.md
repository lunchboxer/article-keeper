# Daily grind: The lives of kids in ancient civilizations

Hey kids! Do you wonder what life was like for other kids way, way back in ancient times? Get ready to find out!

Long ago, most kids did not go to school like you. Instead, they started working and learning skills from their parents around age 5 or 6! Girls helped their moms cook, clean, sew and weave cloth. Boys went hunting and farming with their dads. No summer breaks for them!

Farm kids woke up very early to start chores before sunrise. They fed animals, got eggs from the hens, and carried water from wells. After a fast breakfast, they went to the fields to plant seeds, care for crops, and pick vegetables. That was hard work for little hands! At lunch, they gobbled up cheese, nuts, veggies and porridge to get more energy.

But not all ancient kids were poor peasants and farmers. In big cities like Rome, Greece and Egypt, richer kids had tutors for school. They learned reading, math, music, grammar, and public speaking. Kids of nobles and pharaohs trained at temples too. But when lessons finished, these kids still practiced music and sports, and helped at home. No lazing around for upper class children!

Playtime was rare for ancient youth. Crafts, board games, playing with pets or toys, and festivals were the main ways to have fun. Horseback riding, swimming, hunting, wrestling and ball games like juggling, catch, and soccer were active hobbies. Ancient kids played games like Blind Man’s Bluff, Tag, Hide and Seek, and Hopscotch too. Pretty similar to what you like on the playground!

Chores, school, work - what about playtime, you ask? Well, kids liked dolls, toy chariots and carts, spinning tops, balls and stick games. They loved animals and had pets like dogs, birds, gazelles, monkeys and lambs. Going to the zoo was checking out ostrich races, hippo wrangling, or elephant shows in big outdoor arenas! More exciting than the circus.

For treats, kids couldn’t grab sugary snacks and sodas from the kitchen. Fruits like figs, dates, and pomegranates, and nuts were typical goodies. Olives and goat cheese gave some savory flavor. Hearty soups and stews with lentils, beans, veggies or barley filled up empty tummies. And for feasts, roasted ox or goose was served! Yum, pass the baklava for dessert.

Camping back then meant sleeping under the stars on long trips for trade, war, or pilgrimage. Picture “glamping” in goat-hair tents with campfires, but no mattresses or flashlights! Soldiers, explorers and travelers journeyed for months, facing harsh weather and robbers. Some crazy field trips!

Though daily life was hard for ancient youth, it wasn’t all work and no fun. Kids found ways to play with simple toys and games when they got a break from tasks. And while school, chores and jobs kept their hands full, family gave them community and purpose. So the next time you don’t want to do homework or clean your room, think of how kids survived and thrived thousands of years ago! Hope you enjoyed this trip way back in time!
