# How Your Culture and Values Shape Your View of Art

What do you think when you see a painting or hear a song? Believe it or not, your culture and values affect how you experience art! Art can look, sound, and feel totally different depending on where and how you grew up.

Let's imagine two 10-year-old kids - Jamie from Japan and Maria from Mexico. If Jamie and Maria walked into an art museum together, they might have really different reactions to the same paintings!

Jamie might connect more with delicate ink paintings of nature scenes. This type of art is popular in Japan and reflects values like subtlety and living in harmony with nature. Maria might be more excited about vibrant folk art with bold colors and patterns. This reflects values in Mexican culture like expressing emotion and celebrating community.

Or imagine Jamie and Maria listening to music. Jamie might feel calm listening to tranquil flute music. Maria might feel energized by fast-paced mariachi bands with trumpets and guitars. Their cultures influence their emotional responses.

When you make art yourself, your culture also shapes the type of art you create. For example, both Jamie and Maria could take an art class at school. Jamie might paint a quiet landscape of a lake. Maria might paint a fun village scene with lots of people. Their choice of subject and style would reflect their different backgrounds.

The country where you grow up affects your view of art. But so does your family! Imagine Jamie has one sister. Maria has five brothers and sisters. Jamie might tend to make art by himself at home. Maria might make art as a noisy family activity! Their experiences as kids in their families leads to different art styles.

Your community also plays a role. Jamie might see tidy gardens with neat rows of flowers. Maria might see overflowing pots of sunflowers outside every door. These surroundings appear in their art.

As you can see, where we come from has a big impact on our art. Next time you make or observe art, think about your culture and values. Your upbringing shapes your creative view in many ways!
