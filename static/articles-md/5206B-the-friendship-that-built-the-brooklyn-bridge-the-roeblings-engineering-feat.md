# The Friendship That Built the Brooklyn Bridge: The Roeblings' Engineering Feat

The Brooklyn Bridge in New York City is one of the most famous bridges in the world. The bridge connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by going over the East River. But do you know how the Brooklyn Bridge was built?

The Brooklyn Bridge was designed by an engineer named John A. Roebling. He had already built many suspension bridges. A suspension bridge has cables that hold up the bridge deck. In 1869, Roebling started working on plans for the Brooklyn Bridge. He wanted it to be the longest suspension bridge ever made.

But soon after starting the project, Roebling got hurt badly while looking at where the bridge would go. A ferry boat crushed his foot. Roebling got tetanus from his injury. Tetanus makes your muscles tighten up very painfully. Sadly, Roebling died from tetanus shortly after the accident.

Roebling's son Washington took over building the bridge. Washington had helped his dad with bridges before. But not long after he began working on the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington got sick too. He got decompression sickness, also called "the bends." This happens when you come up from deep water too fast. The bends made Washington very sick. He had to stay in bed and couldn't go to the construction site.

Even though he was stuck in bed, Washington still managed the whole bridge building project. He watched the workers through a telescope from his bedroom window. Washington's wife Emily also helped out a lot. She learned engineering while the bridge was being built. Emily passed messages between the construction workers and her husband. She made many big decisions on her own as well. The Roeblings worked as a team even when they couldn't be together.

It took 14 years for the workers to finish building the Brooklyn Bridge. When it opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was an amazing feat of engineering. Its main span was the longest in the world at the time. The bridge towers were built from granite, limestone, and cement. Huge cables held up the weight of the bridge and traffic. At first, people worried the bridge might fall down. So P.T. Barnum led a parade of 21 elephants over the bridge to show it was sturdy!

The Brooklyn Bridge has stood strong for over 100 years now. Today it carries cars, trains, bikers, and walkers between the boroughs. The Roeblings built more than a bridge. With teamwork and determination, they connected two great cities.
