# Geothermal energy: Using Earth's underground heat

Have you ever wondered where the heat comes from that warms your home? Most homes are heated by burning stuff like natural gas, oil, or coal. But there is another way to get heat without burning any fuels! This is called geothermal energy.

Geothermal energy uses the natural heat inside the Earth to heat homes and buildings. The word "geo" means Earth. And "thermal" means heat. So geothermal energy is Earth's heat!

The inside of the Earth is very, very hot. Just a few miles down, it's over 700 degrees Fahrenheit! This heat comes from when the Earth was first made billions of years ago. It also comes from radioactive stuff like uranium deep underground.

To use geothermal energy, wells are drilled into the ground. This brings up hot water or steam from way down below. The water can be over 300 degrees! The hot water is pumped through a machine to take out the heat. This heats the water that warms a building. After the heat is removed, the now cooler water goes back down into the Earth through another well.

One great thing about geothermal energy is it gives heat all the time. Even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. The Earth makes heat every day of the year! And best of all, once the wells are drilled, geothermal energy doesn't make any pollution.

Geothermal energy is used most places with hot springs or geysers, like Iceland or Yellowstone. But new technologies let us get geothermal heat almost anywhere by drilling deeper wells. Now there are geothermal heating systems in all 50 states!

One geothermal system can heat many buildings. Colleges are great for geothermal because they have lots of buildings needing heat and cooling close together. For example, a university in Indiana heats and cools over 4 million square feet of buildings with geothermal energy from about 700 wells!

Geothermal energy can also make electricity. Hot water from geothermal areas can turn generators like steam from burning coal or gas does. Countries like the Philippines and Iceland get up to 25% of their electricity from geothermal power plants!

As we use up fossil fuels, we need renewable energy like geothermal more and more. The Earth has huge amounts of heat we can use - we just need to drill down and tap into it! So next time you feel cozy heat, think about the secret heating under your feet bringing you geothermal energy!
