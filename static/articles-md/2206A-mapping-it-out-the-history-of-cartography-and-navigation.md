# Mapping it out: The history of cartography and navigation

Have you ever wondered how people long ago were able to travel to new places without getting lost? Or how mapmakers were able to draw accurate maps before satellites and computers? The history of mapmaking and navigation is fascinating!

For thousands of years, explorers have used maps and compasses to help them find their way. Early maps were very simple and not always accurate. The earliest maps were made by ancient peoples like the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese. These maps helped them keep track of landmarks and territories.

The first compasses were invented in China around 200 BC. Early compasses were used for fortune telling and divination. But by the 1100s AD, compasses became vital navigation tools for sailors. With a compass, sailors could figure out which direction was north, south, east and west, even when they couldn't see land or the stars.

During the Age of Exploration starting in the 1400s, European sailors used compasses to travel to Africa, Asia and the Americas. Mapmaking became very important. Accurate maps helped sailors navigate long voyages across oceans.

Mapmaking improved a lot during the Renaissance. New tools like the telescope, quadrant and mechanical clock helped explorers determine their latitude and longitude at sea. Maps became more detailed and realistic.

Today, cartography (mapmaking) uses cuttingedge technology. Satellite imagery, aerial photography, computers and software allow modern mapmakers to create accurate 3D maps that show landscape, buildings, roads and more. Apps like Google Maps use global positioning systems (GPS) to track a phone or car's location anywhere on Earth.

Mapping our world continues to evolve. New techniques like GIS (geographic information systems) allow us to collect, store and analyze all kinds of geographic data. Scientists are even mapping outer space! The future of navigation promises to be out of this world.
