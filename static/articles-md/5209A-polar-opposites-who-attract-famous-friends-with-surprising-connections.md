# Polar Opposites Who Attract: Famous Friends with Surprising Connections

Have you ever heard the saying “opposites attract”? Well, it’s true! Some of the most famous friendships are between people who seem like total opposites. Keep reading to learn about some of the most unexpected BFFs.

First up are comedy legends and best buds Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner. Mel is known for his wacky, slapstick movies like Blazing Saddles. Carl took a more subtle, cerebral approach in films like The Jerk. Despite their different senses of humor, these two funnymen hit it off right away when they met in the 1950s. They’ve been close ever since. Mel and Carl went from comedy club pals to neighbors – they lived next door to each other for years!

Another unlikely pair is former president George W. Bush and famous rocker Bono. Yup, a Republican politician and a liberal rock star managed to become great friends! What brought these two together was a shared desire to fight AIDS/HIV in Africa. Bono’s activist group worked with Bush’s administration to provide aid to African countries. Though they don’t agree on everything, Bono says he and George W. still “get along fine.”

Here’s a friendship duo you really wouldn’t expect – Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. Martha is the ultimate homemaker and Snoop is a famous rapper. They seem about as different as can be! But back in 2008, Martha and Snoop met on a talk show and hit it off. They realized that they’re both super creative people who love to cook. Now Snoop and Martha are total BFFs. They’ve cooked together on TV, baked holiday brownies, and even use cute nicknames for each other (Snoop calls Martha “Martha Stewaty”).

Next up are two famous actresses who became close pals: Gwyneth Paltrow and Jay-Z. Gwyneth is known for her posh lifestyle and healthy habits. Jay-Z is a hip-hop mogul. But despite their different images, Gwyneth and Jay-Z bonded over a shared love of their home city, New York. Gwyneth says Jay is “one of the most good people I know” and they text weekly.

The last oddball duo is comedians Larry David and Bernie Sanders. Larry created the hit show Seinfeld and plays a grumpy curmudgeon. Bernie ran for president as a fiery progressive. But these two Brooklyn boys have been buddies for years. Larry has even done hilarious impressions of Bernie on TV. Though they joke around, Larry and Bernie share a passion for politics and baseball.

Who would have thought these unlikely pals would hit it off? From different backgrounds and with clashing personalities, these friends found common ground. Their surprising stories just go to show that opposites really can attract. You never know who your next BFF will be!
