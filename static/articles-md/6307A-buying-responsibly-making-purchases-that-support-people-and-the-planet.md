# Buying Responsibly - Making purchases that support people and the planet

Have you ever wondered where the things you buy come from? Many of the products we use every day, like clothes, toys, and food, are made by people around the world. When we buy things, we can choose to support companies that make sure their workers and the environment are treated fairly. Here are some tips for being a responsible shopper!

## Buy Local

Buying local means purchasing products that are made near where you live. For example, you could buy produce from a farmer's market instead of a big grocery store. Local farmers often use fewer chemicals and less transportation is needed to get the food to you. This helps the environment! It also supports businesses in your community.

## Buy Organic

Organic foods are grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers that can harm the environment. Animals that produce organic meat, eggs, and dairy aren't given antibiotics or growth hormones either. Organic farming is better for the planet and our health! Look for the USDA Organic seal when shopping.

## Buy Fair Trade

Fair trade means workers who made the products are paid fair wages under good conditions. Many products are made cheaply by underpaying workers. Fair trade makes sure farmers and factory workers around the world are treated well. Items that are fair trade certified include coffee, chocolate, handicrafts, and clothing.

## Buy Eco-Friendly

Eco-friendly products are made in a way that doesn't harm the environment. This might mean using recycled materials, less packaging, or manufacturing processes that reduce waste. For example, cloth shopping bags are reusable and eco-friendly compared to disposable plastic bags. Cleaning supplies made with plant-based ingredients are often eco-friendly too.

## Buy Cruelty-Free

Cruelty-free products are not tested on animals. Many cosmetics and household cleaners are still tested on animals, which can harm them. Choose cruelty-free brands if you want to avoid supporting animal testing. Look for the Leaping Bunny logo or check company websites for their animal testing policies.

Making responsible purchases is easy! Look at labels, do some research, and ask questions about where products come from. Every shopping choice makes a difference. By buying local, organic, fair trade, eco-friendly, and cruelty-free products, you can be part of building a healthier, more just world.
