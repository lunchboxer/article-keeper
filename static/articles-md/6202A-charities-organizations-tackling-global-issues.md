# Charities - Organizations tackling global issues

There are many problems in the world today, like poverty, hunger, and pollution. Lucky for us, there are special groups that try to make the world a better place! These groups are called charities or non-profit organizations. Their job is to raise money and use it to help people and the planet. Let's learn about some cool charities and how they try to fix big global problems!

One huge issue is that many people around the world don't have clean water to drink. It's hard to stay healthy when the only water you have is dirty! There's a charity called charity: water that tries to give people access to clean drinking water. They dig wells and build systems to pump and filter water in places that need it. So far, they have helped over 10 million people get clean water. Wow!

Another big problem is hunger. There are people who don't get enough healthy food to eat. That makes it hard for kids to grow up strong and focus in school. Heifer International is a charity that gives farm animals to families in need. Chickens can lay eggs, cows can give milk, and llamas can help carry heavy loads. These animals provide food to eat and products to sell at the market so families can earn money. Heifer has helped give 33 million families these precious resources!

The environment is important too! We all share the same land, air, and water. Planting trees can make the air cleaner and give animals homes. The Arbor Day Foundation plants millions of trees every year in forests around the world. They also work to protect rainforests that are being cut down. Saving these forests protects all the birds, bugs, and animals that live there. So far, the Arbor Day Foundation has helped plant over 350 million trees!

There are many other great charities too. St. Jude's Children's Hospital helps kids with cancer, even if their families can't pay. Doctors Without Borders sends medical workers to areas with disease outbreaks and natural disasters. The Nature Conservancy buys land and makes nature preserves for plants and animals.

Charities rely on donations from kind people who want to help out. Many hold fundraisers and events where people can give money. You can also donate online through their websites. Even a small donation can make a difference when charities work together for the greater good.

We all share this amazing planet Earth. It's important that we take care of each other and the environment too. Charities and non-profit groups allow regular people like you and me to chip in. If we work together and stay hopeful, just imagine how much good we can do!
