# The Pattern and Rhythm of Tiles and Textiles

Look around you. Do you see any tiles or textiles? If you look closely, you'll notice that many of them have interesting patterns and rhythms.

Tiles are used to cover floors, walls, countertops, and even roofs. Over many centuries, creative artisans have designed beautiful, geometric tile patterns. Some patterns use repeating shapes, like squares, triangles, or hexagons. Other patterns have pictures of plants, animals, or people.

The tiles in your kitchen or bathroom probably have simple patterns. But in many famous buildings around the world, you can find incredibly detailed tilework. The Blue Mosque in Istanbul has over 20,000 handmade ceramic tiles inside!

Textiles are woven fabrics used for things like clothing, towels, sheets, and tapestries. Weaving allows for all kinds of textures and patterns in the cloth. Changing the color and spacing of the threads creates unique designs.

Some patterns, like stripes, plaids, and checks, use straight lines and squares. Other patterns mimic shapes found in nature, like flowers and vines. More abstract patterns play with curves, dots, and symmetry.

Traditional textiles from places like Peru, India, and Morocco often have patterns with cultural meaning. For instance, Native American blankets use diamond and triangle designs that represent mountains, lightning, and rain.

Next time you look at tiles or textiles, see if you can spot repetitions in the patterns. Notice how the designs are built from smaller shapes that repeat over and over. Pay attention to how patterns can set up rhythms, like the beat of a song. The patterns almost seem to dance before your eyes!

So the next time you walk on a tiled floor or cuddle up in a cozy blanket, think about the math and culture woven into the fabric. The history of civilization can be found in the pattern and rhythm of our tiles and textiles!
