# Kids' life long ago: How children lived in ancient times

What was life like for kids a very long time ago? It was really different from your life today!

In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, most kids did not go to school. Only rich kids got to learn reading, writing, and math. Poor kids started working at age 5 or 6. Boys worked on farms with their dads or learned jobs like building with stone or woodwork. Girls helped their moms cooking, cleaning, and taking care of babies.

Even though they worked hard, ancient kids still played! Egyptian kids played with toys like dolls, toy soldiers, balls, tops, and board games. Greek kids played leap frog, tug of war, hide and seek, hoops and sticks, and a game with stones like jacks.

Clothes were not like yours. In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, most kids wore simple loose shirts or dresses made of linen or wool. Shoes were rare - most kids went barefoot. Only rich kids wore fancy clothes, hairdos, and jewelry.

There were no cars or buses. If they traveled, ancient kids rode in carts pulled by donkeys, horses, or oxen. Most people lived and worked on farms, so kids didn't go far from home. Going to a market in a nearby village would have been very fun!

Food was healthier in some ways than today. There were no sugary candy or soda. Most kids ate fruits, vegetables, eggs, cheese, and bread they grew themselves. But there were no grocery stores - droughts and famines were common, so poor families often didn't have enough food.

People didn't live as long back then, so childhood sicknesses and injuries that can be fixed today were often deadly. Families were big, with 5 or more kids, but many babies died, so only a few kids would grow up.

While ancient kids' chores, clothes, food, and schools were different, they still laughed and played like you. Thinking about ancient kids shows that while some things change over time, the fun of being a kid stays the same!
