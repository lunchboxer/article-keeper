# Drawing Faces and Figures Like a Pro

Have you ever wanted to draw cool pictures of people but weren’t sure where to start? Drawing faces and figures can be tricky, but with a few tips and lots of practice you can learn to draw like a pro!

## Starting with Shapes

One of the easiest ways to draw a person is to begin with simple shapes. Circles and ovals make great heads. Squares and rectangles can be bodies. Triangles work well for clothing. Once you have the shapes mapped out, you can start adding details.

First draw a circle for the head. Then sketch in two almond shapes for eyes and a triangle for the nose. Don’t forget eyebrows and a mouth! Oval shaped ears on each side of the head are important too.

Neck and shoulders come next. Draw two lines at angles downward from the circle to represent the neck and shoulders. Arms can be added as sticks coming out of the shoulders. Bend the arm lines to show movement.

For the body, start with a square shape under the neck. Draw oval hips attached to the square. Legs are two lines extending down from the hips. Don't forget knees and feet! Circle shaped knees look neat. Stick feet with a rectangle base finish the pose.

## Drawing Accurate Faces

The most important part of drawing people is getting the face right. Making sure facial features are in the correct place takes practice. But here are some tricks:

Eyes are about halfway between the top of the head and chin. There should be enough room to fit another eye in between them.

Noses are as wide as one eye usually. The bottom of the nose is halfway between eyes and chin.

Lips land right below the nose. The mouth is about as wide as the space between the eyes.

Ears extend from around the eyebrow line to the bottom of the nose. They match up with the top and bottom of eyes.

Once you have placed all the features, it’s time for details! Add eyelashes, pupils, eyebrows, nostrils and ear holes. Don’t forget wrinkles, freckles, or hair. Then your portrait will really come to life!

## Drawing the Body

Bodies can be tricky, but here’s a great tip. The average person is about 7 1/2 heads tall. Keep this in mind when sketching bodies.

Start with a stick figure lightly. Draw circles for joints like shoulders, elbows, hips and knees. Then connect with lines. These will be your guide.

Now rough out shapes for torso, arms and legs. Torso is an oval, arms are tubes, and legs are tapered tubes. Hands and feet can be sketched as puffy mittens and boots for now.

Once you have the framework, sculpt the shapes into muscles. Add lines for limbs bending, clothes wrinkling, etc. Also indicate the neck, collar, or any background elements.

Finally, go over your initial pencil lines with sharper, darker lines. Erase any sketches you don’t need. Careful line work makes your drawing look polished.

## Practicing Makes Perfect

Like any skill, drawing takes time and dedication to improve. Set aside time each day to practice. Focus on drawing individual facial features before tackling full portraits. Break the body down into sections as well.

Use photos or mirrors to draw from life when possible. Drawing from real people will help you master proportions and perspective. Sketch people on the bus, at school, or from your family photos for practice.

Over time you will get better at sketching faces and figures from your imagination. Keep on creating art and learning new techniques. With hard work you’ll be drawing like a pro in no time!
