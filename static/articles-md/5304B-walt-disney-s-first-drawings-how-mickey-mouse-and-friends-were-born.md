# Walt Disney's First Drawings: How Mickey Mouse and Friends Were Born

Walt Disney loved to draw when he was a boy. He sketched farm animals on paper. Then he flipped the pages to make the animals move. It was like magic! When Walt was older, he took art classes in high school. He made funny cartoons for the school newspaper.

After high school, Walt moved to Kansas City. That is where he created his first cartoon character. His name was Newman Laugh-O-Grams. Newman was a little boy who had silly adventures. Kids liked the cartoons. But Walt didn't have enough money to make more.

So Walt went to Hollywood to try his luck. Things were hard at first. Walt and his brother Roy started a company called Disney Brothers Studio. But their cartoons did not become super popular right away.

One day, Walt was riding the train home after a bad business meeting. To pass time, he started doodling a mouse. The mouse had big round ears and a long skinny tail. Walt called him Mortimer Mouse. But his wife Lillian thought Mortimer sounded too fancy. They changed the name to Mickey Mouse instead.

In 1928, Walt made a cartoon called Plane Crazy with Mickey Mouse. Not many people noticed it. Later that year, Walt created Steamboat Willie starring Mickey. It was a big hit! It had sound, which was new. Mickey dances, sings, and whistles a funny song. Everyone loved Mickey Mouse!

After Steamboat Willie, Mickey got really famous. Walt and his artists worked hard to make more Mickey cartoons. Mickey started appearing in comic books and on products. You saw him everywhere!

Walt didn't only make Mickey. In 1934, Donald Duck debuted in a cartoon called The Wise Little Hen. Donald had a bad temper that made people laugh. Then in 1935, Goofy appeared for the first time in Mickey's Service Station. Pluto the puppy and Minnie Mouse joined in the fun too. Walt had a whole crew of characters!

For many years, Walt Disney made magical cartoons. They brought happiness to children and grown-ups around the world. It all started with a simple mouse sketch on a train ride. That little mouse became the famous Mickey Mouse. We still love Mickey today! Walt once said, "I only hope that we never forget one thing...it all started with a mouse."
