# Maglev Trains: Floating on Magnets at Incredible Speeds

Imagine a super-fast train that glides smoothly and quietly just above its tracks. It looks like it's flying on air! These awesome trains are called maglev trains. Maglev is short for magnetic levitation. They use the power of magnets to float a few inches over the guideway that they zoom along.

How do these magic trains float? There are magnets on the bottom of the train. There are also magnets lining the guideway. Some magnets attract each other. Some magnets push apart. By controlling which magnets pull and which ones push, the train can float in the air!

The guideway also has tunnels on the sides that the train rushes through. As the train speeds by, it makes a cushion of air in the tunnels. This air pillow helps hold the train up too. So maglev trains are floating on both magnets AND air!

Maglev trains are really cool and different from regular trains. Normal trains have steel wheels that roll on steel tracks. The wheels rubbing against the tracks makes friction, which slows the train down. Maglev trains have no friction because they never touch the guideway. This lets them go incredibly fast, over 300 miles per hour! That's faster than an airplane!

With no friction, maglev trains can speed up and slow down very smoothly. Passengers have a comfortable ride, with no bumping or jerking. And since they aren't grinding steel on steel, maglevs are very quiet, like a gentle breeze. They are also safer, because normal electric trains get power from touching electrified rails. Maglevs don't need to touch anything to move!

Countries like Japan, Germany, and China are all trying to build better maglevs. China has the fastest one running right now. It can go 267 miles per hour! It carries people from Shanghai to the airport in only 7 minutes! In the future, engineers hope maglevs will go over 375 miles per hour. That would get you from New York to Washington DC in less than an hour!

Maglev trains could connect cities all over the world someday. They would be a clean and green way to travel because they run on electricity, not gas. Many designs also cover up the guideway, which makes them even quieter. Maglevs can go up steep hills and around tight turns that regular trains can't. That means they can take more direct routes.

In just the next 10-20 years, super-fast maglev trains may come to cities near you! With magnetic magic, they'll zip you home for dinner or across the country for vacation. The future of maglev travel looks shiny and bright!
