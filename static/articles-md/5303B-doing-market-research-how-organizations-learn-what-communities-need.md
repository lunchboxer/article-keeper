# Doing Market Research: How Organizations Learn What Communities Need

Companies need to know what kinds of products and services they should sell. They need to find out what people want and need. How do they do this? By doing **market research**!

Market research is when companies study communities. They want to learn about what people need and what they think. This helps companies decide what to sell.

There are two main types of market research. **Primary research** is when companies ask people questions directly. They might do surveys, hold focus groups, or talk to people one-on-one. **Secondary research** uses info that already exists. Companies can look at census data, sales records, or magazine articles.

After they collect the research, companies look for **patterns and trends**. If many people say they want cleaner cleaning supplies, the company may make new "green" cleaners. If sales records show a product isn't selling well, they might stop selling it.

Big toy companies like Hasbro have whole teams that do market research. They visit schools, talk to kids, and look at toy sales records. This shows them which new toys and games to make.

Other companies hire outside firms to do research. These firms are good at surveys, focus groups, and data analysis. Whether inside or outside the company, the goal is the same. They want to really understand what customers need.

Doing market research takes time and money. But it really pays off for companies. When they do their homework, they make products people want. Customers are happier, and companies earn more money. It's a "win-win"!
