# Holiday Heroics: Amazing Feats Performed on Special Days

Holidays are times for relaxing and spending time with family. But some people use holidays as a chance to do incredible things! Read on to learn about some wild and wacky holiday feats.

On New Year's Eve in 2017, Danish athlete Stig Severinsen set a world record by holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes! That's longer than an entire TV show episode. Severinsen trained hard so his body needed less oxygen. He meditated to stay calm and slow his heart rate. His underwater holiday heroics broke the old record by four whole minutes. 

In the USA, the Fourth of July is a chance to celebrate freedom with fireworks. But professional daredevil Robbie Knievel decided to jump over fireworks in 2015. He revved up his motorcycle and raced over a 148-foot wide fireworks display. The sparkling rockets exploded all around him as he flew high in the sky. Knievel stuck the impossible landing, proving his holiday heroism to the cheering crowd.

Halloween is a spooky night for wearing costumes. In 2018, illusionist David Blaine dressed up as his own floating balloon replica for a crazy holiday stunt. Over Arizona, he climbed a long cable from a real helium balloon up to the pretend balloon costume. He spent over an hour "floating" thousands of feet above the ground pretending to be a balloon himself. His silly holiday heroics scared and amazed the people who saw him. 

The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah was the night Chris McDougall ran the longest official race ever in 2005. He ran for 24 hours straight, covering over 175 miles around a high school track. That's like running from Philadelphia to New York City without a single break! McDougall ran all night and day, proving holiday heroics come in all forms.  

On the Christian holiday of Easter, a huge annual egg hunt takes place on the White House lawn. In 1999, brave athlete GiGi Fernandez decided to find all the eggs while rolling an egg across her racquet like a tennis ballâ€”over 200 times without dropping it! She bounced, batted and rolled the egg perfectly in an awesome holiday feat.

Holidays are the perfect time for people to challenge themselves in fun new ways! What amazing acts of holiday heroics can you come up with?
