# How Emojis are a Modern Form of Communication

Do you like using emojis when you text your friends? Emojis are the cute pictures and symbols you can add to messages. They show how you feel without using words. Emojis make talking more colorful and fun!

Emojis have gotten very popular over the last 10 years. In 2015, the laughing emoji face was the Oxford Dictionary “Word of the Year”! This shows that emojis have become a big part of how we communicate now.

## Where Emojis Came From

The first emoji was made in 1999 by a Japanese man named Shigetaka Kurita. He worked at a cell phone company and wanted texting to be more fun. At first there were only 172 emojis, mostly just faces and signs.

Emojis got very popular in Japan. By 2010, they were added to phones all over the world. Today there are over 3,000 emojis, and more keep getting added!

## Why We Use Emojis

One reason emojis are so popular is they help show emotion in texts. Plain messages can be hard to understand. A happy or sad emoji helps see the tone.

Emojis also let you share ideas fast. You can send a pizza emoji instead of typing “let’s eat pizza tonight.” Emojis are quick and creative.

Last, emojis are enjoyable! Picking the right emoji to match your mood or react to a text feels good. The colorful icons make conversations more fun.

## Emojis Get More Detailed

As emojis got more popular, they expanded beyond faces and hand symbols. Now there are emojis for almost anything!

There are emojis for different foods like pizza, doughnuts, and spaghetti. Cute animal emojis like pandas, cats, and whales are very popular. You can even find emojis for things like sewing, biking, and playing guitar.

New emojis are added each year based on trends and what people ask for. In 2023, new emojis were added for a shaking face, blueberries, and a wifi symbol. Emojis really match modern life!

## How Emojis Change Communication

Some wonder if using emojis is making communication worse. Typing a picture icon instead of words seems lazy to some.

But studies show emojis actually help us communicate better. They put back emotion missing from short texts. Emojis also lighten the mood and make talks more fun.

So don’t be afraid to use emojis in your next text or email! The right emoji can make your message more positive and clear. Just don’t overdo it—a few emojis go a long way!
