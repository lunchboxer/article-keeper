# Wild facts about electric and magnetic fields

Get ready to get charged up about some electrifying science! Electricity and magnetism are pretty powerful forces that we use every day. Let's check out some wild facts about electric and magnetic fields!

First, what exactly are electric and magnetic fields? An electric field surrounds any electric charge, like the electrons that flow through wires and make our lights turn on. A magnetic field surrounds any magnet. These invisible fields push and pull on other charges and magnets. Pretty cool!

Now let's get to the fun facts!

- Your body has its own tiny electric field. It's created by electrical signals traveling through your nerves and muscles. That's how your brain can tell your legs to start walking!

- Electric eels don't actually shock you with electricity. They use their special cells to create a powerful electric field that zaps anything nearby. Zap!

- The Earth has its own magnetic field that protects us. It stretches from the planet's core out into space, shielding us from solar storms and radiation. Thanks, magnetic field!

- An electromagnetic field is created when an electric field and magnetic field combine their forces. Things like radio waves, microwaves, and even visible light are all different kinds electromagnetic fields. wild!

- The strongest artificial magnetic field was created in a lab in Florida. Over 1 million times stronger than a fridge magnet, it could rip a credit card apart in seconds!

- Magnetic fields are great for creating electricity. In power plants, coils of wire spin inside giant magnets to generate the electricity that powers our homes.

- High voltage power lines create electric and magnetic fields that extend into our neighborhoods. But don't worry, at normal levels they are considered safe. Phew!

Who knew electricity and magnetism were so fascinating! Now you're full of shocking new knowledge about these invisible forces around us. Stay charged up and keep exploring the amazing science of our world!

## Glossary

- electrons - tiny particles with a negative electrical charge that flow through wires
