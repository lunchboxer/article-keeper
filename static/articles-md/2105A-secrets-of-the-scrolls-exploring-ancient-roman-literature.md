# Secrets of the scrolls: Exploring ancient Roman literature

Long ago, before books and computers, ancient Romans wrote their stories and ideas on scrolls made of paper called papyrus. Papyrus was made from a plant that grew near the Nile River in Egypt.

Scrolls were rolled up like posters so they could be carried around easily. To read a scroll, you had to carefully unroll it, scanning the text from top to bottom. Some scrolls were over 30 feet long!

The Romans wrote all kinds of things on scrolls - poetry, history, science, and even recipes! Many ancient Roman scrolls have been lost over time, but archaeologists are still digging up new ones. What secrets might these old scrolls contain? Let's peek inside the mysterious world of ancient Roman literature!

## Epic Poems and Mythology

The Romans loved epic hero stories like the Greeks' tales of Odysseus and Achilles. Roman writers created their own epic hero - Aeneas, who escaped from Troy after it was burned down in the Trojan War. A famous Roman poem called the "Aeneid" tells of Aeneas' exciting but dangerous journey to Italy where he became an ancestor of the Romans.

Roman writers also penned many versions of Greek myths. In the myth "Orpheus and Eurydice", Orpheus must journey to the underworld to rescue his bride Eurydice after she dies from a poisonous snake bite right after their wedding! Spoiler alert: It doesn't end well for the loving couple. The Romans' retelling of this emotional myth inspired paintings, poems, and operas for centuries to come.

## Histories of Rome

Roman historians also wrote important works explaining Rome's rise from a small town to a mighty civilization. One famous Roman historian, Tacitus, wrote books called the "Annals" and the "Histories". These gripping histories described the dramatic and often scandalous lives of Rome's leaders - the emperors!

From Caesar Augustus, Rome's first emperor, to the crazy Caligula who ordered his soldiers to collect seashells as "spoils of war", Tacitus packed his histories with juicy details and gossip. It's like reading about a modern-day royal family!

## Science for Farming...and Warfare

While Roman poetry and history texts are fascinating, practical scientific writing was also important. For example, Roman authors penned agricultural manuals describing the best ways to farm olives, grapes, and grains. With volcanoes erupting nearby, Romans had to get creative to grow enough food!

Military science was also key. Roman army engineers wrote manuals about catapults and other siege weapons used to attack enemy cities. The Romans used these terrible contraptions to hurl heavy projectiles (like giant boulders) to smash down walls and gates.

Roman military manuals even contained recipes for nasty poisons! When dropped into enemy water supplies, these toxins brought a slow and painful death. Ancient Roman warfare was definitely not for the faint of heart.

## What Else Lies Within?

For centuries, scholars have treasured the literary treasures of Rome, but many ancient scrolls still remain buried and hidden away. As archaeologists continue to dig up lost Roman writing, who knows what other adventures, myths, histories, or secrets we may uncover? The next great Roman work could be unearthed at any moment!
