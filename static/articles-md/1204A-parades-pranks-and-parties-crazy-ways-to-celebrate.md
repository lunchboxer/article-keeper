Get ready for some wild and wacky ways to party! From parades to pranks, people sure know how to have a good time. Here are some of the craziest celebrations from around the world.

## Mardi Gras in New Orleans

Mardi Gras is one of the biggest parties in the world. Every year, over 1 million people gather in New Orleans to celebrate before Lent. Mardi Gras kicks off with wild parades. People dress up in crazy costumes and throw beads and treats to the crowds. There are bands, dancers, and colorful floats. Some parades even have celebrities! After the parades comes the feasting. People eat tasty Cajun food like jambalaya, étouffée, and king cake. No Mardi Gras is complete without lots of music and dancing. Laissez les bons temps rouler!

## April Fools' Day Pranks

Get ready for some foolish fun on April 1st! April Fools' Day is all about pulling pranks and tricks. In Scotland, they celebrate "Hunt the Gowk Day." Gowk means cuckoo bird. People try to trick each other by sending them on silly errands to find things that don't exist! In Portugal, folks try to stick paper fish to each other's backs without getting caught. The fish symbolize the gullible fish who get tricked. One of the wildest April Fools' pranks was the spaghetti harvest hoax. In 1957, a news show fooled people into thinking spaghetti grew on trees! People called wanting to grow their own spaghetti trees. What a noodle-brained prank!

## Songkran Water Festival

Cool off at the world's biggest water fight! Songkran is the Thai New Year's festival in April. People celebrate by splashing water on each other to wash away bad luck from the old year. The water fun goes on for three whole days! People soak strangers with water guns, buckets, hoses, and water balloons. There are also parades with people dressed in traditional clothes. At night, people release floating lanterns on rivers to send wishes to heaven. The water madness continues with foam parties where people spray thick, white foam instead of water! Talk about a sudsy celebration!

## Las Fallas in Valencia

Get ready for Las Fallas, Spain's loudest party! "Las Fallas" means "the fires" in Spanish. Every March, huge cardboard statues appear all over Valencia. Some are as tall as 10-story buildings! The statues, called "ninots," poke fun at celebrities and politicians. After a week of parades, fireworks, concerts, and paella feasts, it all ends in a bonfire. On the final night, the ninots go up in flames in a huge fire. People light their own firecrackers too, for a noisy, fiery finale! It's one incendiary party!

From parades to pranks, people sure know how to live it up! What wild ways would you celebrate? Use your imagination to come up with your own crazy celebration!
