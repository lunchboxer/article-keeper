# The Universal Language of Shapes and Symbols

When you look around, you see shapes and pictures everywhere! People all over the world use the same basic shapes and symbols. Even if they don’t speak the same language, they understand what these shapes and pictures mean. Shapes like circles, squares, triangles and stars are global. Simple images like smiley faces, hearts, and arrows are universal. Shapes and symbols are like a visual language everyone can understand!

Let’s look at shapes. The **circle** is one of the most common shapes. Circles are found in nature, flags, signs, art and more. Circles stand for ideas like unity, wholeness and forever. The round shapes of the sun and full moon are circle symbols used by many cultures. Lots of country flags have circles, like in Japan, Brazil, and Bangladesh.

The **square** has four equal sides and four 90-degree angles. It's a steady, balanced shape used in buildings and designs for thousands of years. Squares show strength, perfection and order. Windows, buildings, picture frames and dice are real-life squares.

Now let's look at symbolic shapes. The five-pointed **star** is an old symbol in flags and art everywhere. Stars often mean hope, spirituality, success and dreams. The star and crescent moon is popular in some Muslim countries. The Star of David is important in Judaism.

Another global shape is the **heart**. Styled hearts can look very different, but people know they’re hearts worldwide. Hearts are number one symbols for love. Heart shapes are seen on candy, cards, jewelry, clothes and more.

When it comes to symbols, simple is best. Basic lines and shapes that look real are easy for our brain to get. For instance, stick figures made of lines, circles and triangles have been used to show people for thousands of years. Arrows made of lines and triangles point the way on signs and diagrams all over.

Some universal symbols are **smiley** and **frowny** faces. Just two dots and a curve that looks happy or sad express emotions. People even hold smartphones sideways to "text" smiley face emojis! No translation needed.

Sharing ideas through shapes and symbols is an international language. Simple circles, squares, hearts and stars speak to cultures everywhere. So next time you see shapes and symbols, think about how they connect us all!
