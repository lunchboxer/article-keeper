# From Garage Startup to Tech Titan: The Evolution of Apple and Pixar

Imagine starting a company in your garage at home! That's how two of the biggest technology companies began - Apple and Pixar.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple. Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith started Pixar. These friends had big dreams and good ideas.

In 1976, Jobs and Wozniak built the first Apple computers by hand in Jobs' family garage. The first computer was called the Apple I. It didn't have a screen or keyboard. Just a board with parts.

Next came the Apple II with a keyboard and screen. It showed color graphics on any TV. People loved it! The Apple II made Jobs and Wozniak millionaires.

By 1984, Apple made the Macintosh. It had pictures on screen called icons. And a mouse to click on them. This changed computing forever! Though Jobs left Apple for a while, his ideas made Apple grow.

Today Apple makes iPhones, iPads, watches and laptops. They changed how we use technology in our daily lives.

In 1979, Catmull and Smith were studying animation at a school in New York. George Lucas asked them to start a graphics group at Lucasfilm. Their goal was to make the first computer animated movie.

In 1986, Steve Jobs bought their group from Lucasfilm and named it Pixar. After many years of work, in 1995 Pixar released Toy Story. It was the first computer animated movie. Fans were amazed by the 3D! Toy Story made over $360 million!

Pixar kept making big hits like A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo. Their fun family films earned billions and won many awards. In 2006, Disney bought Pixar. But Pixar kept its own culture.

The stories of Apple and Pixar show that starting in a garage can lead to huge success. Their hard work and new ideas took them far. They inspire young people today to dream big and try new things too!
