# Adapting to Change: How Organizations Pivot to Stay Relevant

Big companies have to change a lot over many years to keep up. This is hard to do! To stay in business, they need to be ready to change plans quickly when needed. This ability to "pivot" is super important.

Let’s look at some famous pivots from history. Long ago in the 1920s, Nokia made paper stuff like toilet paper! But later they switched to making radios and TVs more.

Then in the 1990s, Nokia started making mobile phones. They became the top phone maker worldwide. But when Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, Nokia didn’t change fast enough. They kept making old-style "dumb phones" too long. So they lost business to Apple and Samsung's smart phones.

Another example is YouTube. At first in 2005 YouTube was a website for video dating! But that didn’t work well. The founders saw that people wanted an easy way to share all kinds of videos. So YouTube changed to become a place where anyone could share videos. This switch let YouTube grow very fast. Now it's one of the biggest websites ever!

Some other big pivots are Twitter, which started as a podcast site, and Instagram, which was first an app to share locations called Burbn. Both companies saw chances to change focus. Those pivots made them really successful!

But changing direction is tricky. Some big changes have failed too. In the 2000s, Blockbuster rented the most videos. But when Netflix started mailing DVD rentals, Blockbuster didn't take them seriously. They didn't pivot to digital. So they went out of business due to Netflix and streaming.

Changing too fast can also be bad. In 2000 AOL and Time Warner combined to make a huge media company worth over $350 billion dollars, the largest ever then! But their cultures didn't fit well together. Just a few years later, they lost tons of money and broke apart.

To adapt, companies must keep up with new tech and trends. They have to try different ideas and business models to see what works. Moving quickly and taking risks is needed. But they should change thoughtfully, without overreacting.

Companies that can pivot at the right times have the best chance of staying around for decades. But it's not easy! So when you hear about a hot new startup shaking up an industry, remember it takes flexibility and the ability to adapt over time.
