# Trailblazers: Adventurers Charting New Land Routes

Hi kids! There have been some really brave people in history who explored new places. They were called trailblazers. Trailblazers went on adventures to find routes across land that no one had gone on before. It was dangerous but they kept going. Let’s read about some of these cool explorers!

A long time ago, Christopher Columbus convinced the king and queen of Spain to give him ships. He wanted to try to sail across the ocean to find a new way to trade with Asia. In 1492, he became the first European person to make it to the Americas across the Atlantic Ocean. His journey started an age of exploration. More people from Europe wanted to go on ships to explore this New World.

In the 1800s, two American explorers named Meriwether Lewis and William Clark went on a big expedition west. They took a group called the Corps of Discovery to map out a land route from the eastern United States all the way to the Pacific Ocean. It was the first time this path had been traveled by Americans. Lewis and Clark met Native Americans and saw new plants and animals along their trail. This opened up the American West.

Around the same time, Zebulon Pike tried to find the beginning of the Mississippi River. He went on expeditions through the Rocky Mountains. He didn’t find the source of the river, but he explored new territory in the southwest. Pikes Peak mountain in Colorado is named after him!

Some brave women also became trailblazers. In 1849, Margaret Frink traveled on the dangerous Overland Trail to reach California and Oregon. She was the first woman to make the hard journey. Esther Morris brought her family in a covered wagon over the Rocky Mountains. Her trail helped many settlers travelling west on the Oregon Trail.

In Australia, explorers were also making trails across the lands inside the country. People like Edmund Kennedy and Thomas Mitchell went inland from the beaches and mapped routes west. Len Beadell built dirt roads called “nun-bah” roads across the Outback in the 1900s. These trailblazers helped open up Australia.

From sailing seas to crossing mountains, these courageous trailblazers changed history. They explored new places and made new paths. When you go on an adventure, think of the trailblazers who went first!
