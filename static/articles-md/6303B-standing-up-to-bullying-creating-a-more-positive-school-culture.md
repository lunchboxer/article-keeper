# Standing Up to Bullying - Creating a more positive school culture

School should be a happy place. But sometimes kids get picked on. When someone is mean to you again and again, that’s called bullying. The bully wants you to feel bad. Some bullies hit or kick. But words can hurt too. Calling names or spreading rumors is bullying too.

Bullying is never okay. If you see it, don’t join in. Tell the bully to stop. Get help from a grown-up. Remind the bully everyone deserves to feel safe at school.

Some kids get bullied because they seem different. Others may get bullied because of how they look, where they’re from, or who they like. But it’s important to be kind to everyone, even if they’re not the same as you. It’s never okay to be mean to someone just because they’re different.

There are lots of ways students and teachers can work together to stop bullying. Put nice notes on classroom doors. Sit with someone who is alone at lunch. Let others join games at recess. Say hi and smile at your classmates. Small acts of kindness help everyone feel welcome.

Many schools now teach students how to stop bullying before it starts. Kids learn to care about each other. Teachers help students understand bullying is wrong. The whole school works together so no one gets bullied.

You can help stop bullying too. If you see someone getting bullied, tell your teacher right away. Keep telling grown-ups until it stops. Telling is not tattling - it helps everyone be safe.

No student should be bullied. To stop it, teachers, parents, and students need to work together. Treat each other with respect. Speak out if you see someone getting teased. With a little care and teamwork, we can stop bullying for good!
