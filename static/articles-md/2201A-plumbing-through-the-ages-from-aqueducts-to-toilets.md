# Plumbing through the ages: From aqueducts to toilets

Hey kids! Do you ever think about where the water comes from when you turn on the faucet or flush the toilet? Believe it or not, people have been figuring out ways to transport water and remove waste for thousands of years! Let's dive into the history of plumbing from ancient aqueducts to modern bathrooms.

Back in ancient Rome around 312 BC, people needed a way to bring fresh water into the city. They built giant structures called aqueducts to transport water from mountains over long distances using gravity. Aqueducts were made from stone and concrete and had arch shaped tunnels on top that water could flow through. At one point, there were over 200 miles of aqueducts bringing water to Rome!

After the fall of the Roman empire around 476 AD, new plumbing advancements slowed down for a while. Most people got their water from wells, springs, or rivers. Waste and sewage were dumped right into the streets! Ick!

Things started looking up around 1596 when Sir John Harrington invented a flushing toilet with a valve to keep out smells. But flushing toilets didn't become common until the 1800s. Until then, most people still used smelly outdoor latrines or chamber pots.

In the early 1800s, new cast iron pipes and plumbing fixtures started being mass produced. Soon, more people started adding sinks, tubs, and toilets indoors, which made things much cleaner and nicer smelling!

Thomas Crapper popularized the siphon system for toilets that is still used today. Fun fact: He didn't actually invent the toilet, but he owned a plumbing company and improved toilet designs.

As cities grew larger in the 1900s, they needed better systems to supply water and remove waste. Builders constructed underground sewer systems that transported waste and storm water away through pipes. Clean water was brought into cities through aqueducts and pump systems.

Today, turning on a faucet or flushing a toilet is as easy as can be. We can thank thousands of years of plumbing trial and error for that! Our modern water supply and sewer systems are engineering marvels that keep us healthy and clean.

Pretty cool how plumbing has evolved over time, huh? From mountain aqueducts moved by gravity, to cast iron pipes and indoor toilets, to today's underground sewers and water treatment plants - we've come a long way!
