# Dress for success: Fashions and clothing over time

Fashion and clothing styles have changed a lot over time! Did you know that people wore very different clothes long ago compared to what we wear today? Let's take a look at how fashions and styles have evolved.

Back in the olden days during the Middle Ages, poor people usually wore simple tunics, or long shirt-like garments made from wool or linen. Rich nobles wore fancy clothes made from velvet, silk, and fur to show off their wealth and status. Knights dressed in metal armor and kings and queens wore extravagant dresses and jeweled crowns.

During the Renaissance around the 1400s and 1500s, styles became more elegant. Rich women wore floor-length gowns with puffy sleeves and men wore tights, puffy shorts, and doublets which were snug jackets worn over shirts. Bows, jewelry, feathers, and rich fabrics like satin were popular accessories.

In the 1700s, wigs were totally in style! Fancy powered wigs showed wealth and status. Women wore tight corsets to cinch their waists and voluminous dresses with wide hoop skirts. Men wore knee-length pants, stockings, vests, and long coats with fancy buttons called frock coats.

The 1800s brought simpler styles. As more people moved out West in America, sturdy denim pants called jeans became popular along with plaid shirts and boots. Towards the end of the century, women's skirts got huge with wire frameworks underneath to create a bell shape. Fancy hats with feathers and lace were a must for both men and women.

In the 1920s, loose, comfortable fashions came into style after World War I. Women wore looser dresses with shorter hemlines and more casual hairstyles. Men wore wide-legged pants and suits with a more relaxed fit. Hollywood movies spread these new fashions worldwide.

During the 1950s, poodle skirts, leather jackets, circle skirts, and saddle shoes were popular. Men wore collared shirts, sweater vests, and narrow pants. The 1960s brought mini-skirts, go-go boots, hippies, and tie-dye clothes. Bell bottom pants, platform shoes, and funky prints ruled the 1970s.

Today, people combine elements from many different eras and cultures. Jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, and hoodies are staples along with fun accessories like hats, jewelry, and designer handbags. One thing is for sure - fashion will continue changing as time marches on! What will be the popular styles of the future? Only time will tell!
