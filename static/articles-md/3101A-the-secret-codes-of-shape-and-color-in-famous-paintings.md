# The Secret Codes of Shape and Color in Famous Paintings

Have you ever looked at a painting and wondered why the artist chose certain colors or shapes? Well, it turns out that many famous artists used colors and shapes to send secret messages in their paintings! Keep reading to uncover some of the hidden meanings behind shapes and colors in famous art.

One artist who was a master at using symbols was the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. In many of Vermeer’s paintings, he included the color blue quite a bit. Vermeer used shades of blue to represent spiritual beauty, calmness, and harmony. For example, in his famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring, the girl wears a striking blue turban. The different blues in the turban suggest the girl has an inner tranquility and grace.

Another important symbol Vermeer used was concentric circles. Concentric circles are circles inside other circles. In his artwork, concentric circles symbolized unity, wholeness, and infinity. For instance, in The Milkmaid, the bread rolls and lidded basket display concentric circles, hinting at ideas of fulfillment and balance.

The founder of modern art, Pablo Picasso, also utilized symbols in his groundbreaking Cubist paintings. Picasso frequently painted triangles to represent masculinity and strength. He painted circles to symbolize femininity and creativity.

For example, in Picasso’s Three Musicians, the man on the left is made up of angular triangular shapes, while the other two figures contain round, curvy forms. Picasso used these shapes to explore ideas about gender. The interlocking shapes also suggest the connection between the three musicians.

Another pioneer of modern art is Piet Mondrian. In his abstract paintings, Mondrian only used straight lines and the three primary colors - red, blue, and yellow. Mondrian believed these colors and lines expressed purity, simplicity, and harmony.

Look closely at Mondrian’s Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow and you will notice the orderly grid of bold colors divided by thick black lines. Mondrian carefully balanced his colors and lines to create a sense of peace and equilibrium.

Next time you visit an art museum, keep an eye out for special shapes and colors. They may reveal deeper meanings about the artist and their work! Artists often put hidden messages in their paintings waiting to be uncovered. With a little detective work, you can learn to interpret the secret code of shapes and colors in famous art.
