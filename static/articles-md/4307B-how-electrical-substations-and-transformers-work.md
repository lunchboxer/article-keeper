# How Electrical Substations and Transformers Work

Hey kids! Getting electricity to your home is like a long road trip. First the electricity is made at a power plant. Then it travels on big transmission lines to get to your town. Finally, it stops at a neighborhood substation before coming to your house. Substations are important pit stops that help electricity finish its long journey.

Inside substations, cool machines called transformers change the strength of the electricity. The strength is called voltage. Transformers lower the voltage so electricity can be used safely at your home. Without substations and transformers, you would get a big shock if you plugged anything in!

## What's Inside a Substation?

Substations have a transmission side and a distribution side. On the transmission side, extra strong electricity comes into the substation on huge transmission lines. The voltage of this electricity is 345,000 volts or more. Volts measure the strength of electricity. That's about 100 times more voltage than the electricity in your home!

The super strong voltage lets the electricity travel a long way without getting tired. It's like a race car that needs a lot of gas to keep going fast for hundreds of miles. If the voltage gets too low before the substation, the electricity won't have enough strength to finish the trip.

On the distribution side, transformers inside the substation lower the voltage below 35,000 volts. Then the lower voltage electricity leaves on smaller lines to neighborhoods.

## How Do Transformers Work?

Transformers don't need any moving parts or electricity to change voltage! They use the power of magnets instead.

Inside every transformer are two coils of wire wrapped around an iron core. Coils are loops of wire and the iron helps the magnets work better. One coil gets the extra strong electricity, turning it into a magnet. This magnet creates a magnetic field that the second coil picks up. The second coil turns the magnetic field back into electricity, but at a lower strength.

It's like two connected garbage cans. One can has water poured in to show the strong electricity. This makes the first can overflow into the second can. But the second can is smaller, so the water is now at a lower level. That's like the lowered voltage electricity!

Transformers work based on how the coils are wrapped. More wraps on the first coil than the second coil makes the voltage go down. Transformers can also make voltage go up if there are more wraps on the second coil instead. This helps the electricity travel through the whole system.

Substations and transformers work hard to bring safe electricity to your home. Next time you plug something in, remember to thank your neighborhood substation and its team of hard working transformers!

## Glossary

- Voltage - The strength of electricity that makes it move through wires.

- Coil - A loop of wire used in transformers that can make a magnet.

- Magnet - Something that can attract metals like iron. Transformers use magnets to change electricity voltage.

- Transmission lines - Big power lines that carry high voltage electricity long distances.
