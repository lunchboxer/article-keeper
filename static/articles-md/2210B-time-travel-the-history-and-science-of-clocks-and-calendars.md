# Time travel: The history and science of clocks and calendars

How did people tell time before clocks and calendars? Early humans used the sun, moon, and stars. As time passed, new tools were invented to keep track of time more exactly.

The first clocks were sundials. Sundials use the sun's place in the sky to show the time. Sundials worked during the day. But they didn't work at night! Water clocks solved this problem. Water clocks used dripping water to mark time passing. A famous water clock was built in ancient Greece around 150 BC. This huge clock was called the Tower of the Winds. It not only told the time, but had cool statues of Greek gods too.

In the Middle Ages in Europe, clocks changed to use gears and weights. An important improvement was the verge escapement, made around 1300. The verge escapement turned the gears at a steady pace. The oldest working verge escapement clock is in a cathedral in England from 1386.

Pendulum clocks came next in 1656. Galileo Galilei studied how a swinging pendulum keeps good time. A Dutch scientist named Christiaan Huygens used Galileo's ideas to build the first pendulum clock. He also invented the minute hand. Before this, most clocks just had an hour hand.

The most accurate clocks today use quartz crystals. In 1927, scientists learned that quartz crystals vibrate at an exact rate with electricity. This allowed quartz clocks in the 1920s and 30s. Quartz clocks keep time right to about 1 second per day, way better than early clocks.

Calendars changed over time too. One early calendar was the Roman calendar from around 700 BC. It had just 10 months and 304 days. Extra days had to be added to match the seasons. In 46 BC Julius Caesar reformed the calendar to the Julian calendar with 12 months and 365 days.

But the Julian calendar still wasn't quite right. Dates drifted over hundreds of years. So in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII made the Gregorian calendar we use now. It fixed the issue by dropping 10 days and having leap years every 4 years. Leap years have 366 days to keep the seasons matched up.

Today, atomic clocks set official time using atoms vibrating. The most accurate atomic clock in the world uses ytterbium atoms. It's right to 1 second in 15 billion years! From sundials to atomic clocks, our timekeeping lets today's technology work across the world.
