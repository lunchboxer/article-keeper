# Revolutions - When Ordinary Citizens Stood Up to Power and Transformed Society

Have you ever felt that something at school or in your town was unfair? Many people in the past felt the same way about their rulers and laws. When enough normal citizens decide to stand up against leaders who are unfair, it can start a revolution.

Revolutions are exciting times when people work together to fix the government and make big changes in their society. Let's learn about some famous revolutions in history!

Back in the 1770s, the American colonists were mad at England. England made laws for the colonies but didn't let the colonists vote or have any say. The colonists had to pay taxes to England without getting rights back. "No taxation without representation!" was a phrase the colonists used to call for change. After years of protests, the colonists decided the only way to gain freedom was to start a revolution.

In 1775, the American Revolution began. It was led by famous founders like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. For many years, the small colonial army battled the large British army. It seemed impossible that the colonists could win. However, with clever plans and determination, the colonists kept fighting. On July 4, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was signed, creating the United States. The revolution showed that even common people could join together to overcome unfair rules.

Over 100 years later, average people in France were inspired by America. In the late 1700s, France was ruled by wealthy kings who lived in luxury while most people were poor. After the French helped America gain freedom, they started wanting liberty in their own country. In 1789, massive protests broke out in Paris. Angry mobs destroyed symbols of the king's power. This began the French Revolution.

Eventually, the king was overthrown and leaders were chosen by the people. The unfair power of nobles and clergy ended in France. Ideas of equality and rights spread. However, the revolution also showed the mess and violence that can happen when long-mistreated citizens violently seize power. Still, the French Revolution inspired people across Europe with ideas of freedom, democracy, and reform.

In the 1900s, the Russian people started one of the biggest revolutions of modern times. Most Russians lived in poverty under the cruel Czar Nicholas II. During World War I, food shortages increased suffering. In 1917, riots began against the czar. When soldiers refused to stop the riots, the czar gave up his throne.

Vladimir Lenin set up a communist government promising "peace, land, and bread" for the people. Lands were shared from rich owners to peasants. The Soviet Union became a powerful new nation. While communism later led to new unfairness in Russia, the uprising succeeded in toppling an unjust system.

Revolutions show that history is shaped by average people. When citizens unite and make sacrifices for change, they can reshape society. Revolutions are turning points reminding us of the power people have when they stand together.
