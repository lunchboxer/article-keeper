# The Magnetic Field of the Earth Explained

The Earth has a magnetic field that surrounds it like an invisible force field! This field makes compasses point north. It also protects us from outer space. Let's learn more about this cool magnetic power.

Deep inside the Earth is a ball of super hot liquid metal. As this liquid swirls around, it creates electric currents. These currents make a giant magnet of the Earth. The magnetic field stretches far out into space around our planet.

The magnetic field does two important things. First, it makes compasses work! The magnetic north pole tugs on the north needle of a compass. This helps explorers find their way when traveling.

Second, the field is like a shield against solar wind. The sun sends out a stream of fast particles. If these particles reached Earth, they could damage power lines and hurt astronauts. But the magnetic field pushes most particles around Earth. It protects us like an invisible shield!

The magnetic north pole is not at the very top of the world. It moves around slowly over time. Right now it is in the Arctic Ocean near Canada. Scientists watch the magnetic field closely. It has gotten a little weaker but should get stronger again.

Other planets like Mars used to have magnetic fields too. But their fields went away. Now solar wind blows their air into space! Earth's strong magnetic field will keep protecting our planet for a very long time.

## Glossary

- compass - A tool with a magnetized needle that points north.
- magnetic field - The area around a magnet where its force can be felt. Earth's magnetic field stretches far out from its core.
- solar wind - The stream of fast particles coming from the sun.
- core - The very hot center of the Earth, made of liquid metal.
