# Fabulous fabrics: The development of ancient textiles

Clothes, towels, blankets, and more are made out of cloth and fabric. But making fabric wasn't always easy! Long ago, people had to use stuff they found in nature to make simple fabrics. Let's explore the past to learn about ancient fabrics like linen, wool, silk, and cotton.

Over 7,000 years ago near the Mediterranean Sea, one of the first fabrics was linen. To make linen, flax plants were grown and prepared. After harvesting flax, people pounded the stiff stalks until they could get the fibers out. This first step was called retting. Then the fibers were combed and twisted into long linen threads. The threads were woven on looms to make linen cloth. Linen was light and cool for hot weather.

About 6,000 years ago, people in cold places started using the thick, fuzzy fur of sheep to make wool yarn. After shearing and washing the sheep, the wool was combed, spun into yarn, and woven into cozy wool clothes for warmth in winter. Wool was special for keeping people toasty.

Another neat ancient fabric is silk, first made in China over 4,000 years ago! Silkworm caterpillars were allowed to create cocoons. The fine, soft silk threads were carefully unwound from the cocoons and woven into shiny silk cloth. Chinese silk was traded on the Silk Road and soon wanted all over. Silk was a fancy fabric worn by kings and queens.

Cotton was also invented thousands of years ago, but it was hard to take the seeds out. Cotton plants have been grown for over 7,000 years. But around 3,000 years ago, cotton gins were created to more easily get the seeds out of the cotton fibers. After ginning, the cotton was spun and woven into cloth. Cotton grew well in hot, humid places and was comfy to put on.

It's amazing that so long ago, without machines, these natural fabrics were invented! Flax, wool, silk, and cotton shaped old cultures and trade. Linen, wool, silk, and cotton are still popular today. So next time you get dressed, think about the history wrapped up in the awesome fabric you're wearing!
