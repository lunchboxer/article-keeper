# Drawing Faces and Figures Like a Pro

Do you want to learn how to draw awesome pictures of people? It can be hard at first. But with some easy tips and a lot of practice, you can learn to draw like a pro!

## Starting with Simple Shapes

One of the best ways to draw a person is to start with basic shapes. Circles or ovals make good heads. Squares or rectangles can be bodies. Triangles are great for clothes. After you have the shapes, you can add details.

First, draw a circle for the head. Then add two almond shapes for eyes and a triangle for the nose. Also draw in eyebrows, eyelashes and a mouth! Don't forget oval ears on each side of the circle.

Next, add the neck and shoulders. Draw two lines down from the circle at angles. These are the neck and shoulders. Stick arms come out of the shoulders. Bend the arms to show movement.

For the body, start with a square under the neck. Draw oval hips attached to the square. Legs are two lines coming down from the hips. Add circle knees and stick feet too!

## Drawing Faces Right

The most important part of a person is their face. Putting the parts in the right spot takes practice. But here are some tips:

Eyes are about halfway between the top of the head and chin. They should have another eye of space between them.

Noses are about as wide as one eye usually. The bottom of the nose is halfway between the eyes and chin.

Lips go right under the nose. The mouth is about as wide as the space between the eyes.

Ears go from near the eyebrows to the bottom of the nose. They match up with the top and bottom of the eyes.

Once the parts are placed, add details! Draw pupils, eyelashes, nostrils and ear holes. Add wrinkles, freckles, or hair too. Then your picture will come alive!

## Drawing the Body

Bodies are tricky, but here’s a cool tip. Most people are about 7 1/2 heads tall. Keep this in mind when you draw.

First, lightly sketch a stick figure. Draw circles at the shoulders, elbows, hips and knees. Connect with lines - these are your guide.

Now add shapes for torso, arms and legs. The torso is an oval, arms are tubes, legs tapered tubes. Hands and feet are mittens and boots for now.

After the framework, turn shapes into muscles. Show bending limbs, clothes wrinkles, etc. Add neck, clothes and background too.

Finally, darken your pencil lines. Erase extra sketches. Dark, clean lines make your drawing look neat.

## Practice Helps You Improve

Like any skill, drawing takes practice to get better. Try to draw every day. Start with eyes or noses before faces. Also break the body into parts.

Use photos or mirrors when possible. Drawing real people helps with sizes and views. Sketch people on the bus, in school, or family pics for practice.

In time you’ll get better at drawing faces and people from your imagination. Keep creating art and learning new things. With hard work you can draw like a pro!
