# Lightning: A natural electric phenomenon

Hey kids! Want to learn some zappy facts about lightning? Get ready for a *shocking* article about this cool natural event!

Imagine you're playing outside on a hot summer day. The air feels heavy. Dark clouds are gathering above your head. All of a sudden—BAM! A bright, jagged flash lights up the sky with a loud BOOM of thunder. That's lightning!

Lightning is a big spark of electricity that happens during thunderstorms. These huge electric sparks can stretch over 5 miles long, and get as hot as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That's hotter than lava from a volcano!

When a storm cloud builds up lots of electric charge, parts of the cloud get positive and other parts get negative. When the pull between the opposite charges gets strong enough—ZAP! Lightning is the huge flash of electricity that jumps between the positive and negative charges either in the cloud or between the cloud and the ground.

Some lightning happens totally inside clouds and can't be seen. But when the flash touches down to the ground, it makes a bright bolt of light streaking through the sky that we can see. The loud rumbling sound of thunder happens because lightning makes the air expand quickly and push out a huge blast of sound.

Lightning strikes the earth over 8 million times every day! It's very dangerous because of all that electricity. If lightning hits you or something near you, the huge blast of electricity can burn skin, make your heart stop beating, and even kill you. Stay inside when thunderstorms are close to avoid getting zapped!

Here are some more electrifying facts about lightning:

- Lightning can heat the air around it to 50,000°F, hotter than lava!

- The longest lightning bolt ever was 199 miles long in Oklahoma.

- Rubber shoes and tires help protect you from lightning since rubber does not carry electricity well.

- Lightning strikes about 6,000 times worldwide every minute. That's a lot of flashes!

- Benjamin Franklin showed lightning is electricity using a kite and key in 1752.

Pretty shocking stuff, huh? Next time there's a thunderstorm brewing, listen for thunder and watch for lightning flashes in the sky. Just be sure to watch nature's electricity show safely from inside!
