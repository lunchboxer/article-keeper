# How early batteries worked to store electricity

Batteries are pretty cool, huh? We use them every day to power our toys, phones, and games. But batteries have actually been around for a super long time! People were using them to make electricity way back in the 1700s. Let me tell you about some of the first batteries ever made.

The very first battery was built in 1799 by an Italian scientist named Alessandro Volta. He made a stack of discs of copper and zinc metal, with cardboard or cloth soaked in salty water between each disc. He called it a “voltaic pile.” When Volta attached wires to the copper and zinc, it produced a steady flow of electricity through the wires. Volta’s pile made enough electricity to create tiny shocks and sparks.

In the 1800s, scientists found that using acids worked even better than salty water in batteries. They started using strong acids like sulfuric acid inside glass jars called Leyden jars. Two metal rods were placed in the acid - one copper and one zinc. This made a simple battery cell that produced about 1-2 volts of electricity.

To get more voltage, they combined several cells together into what we now call a “battery.” An Italian scientist named Giuseppe Zamboni stacked together 2,000 cells to make a huge 2,000 volt battery! He used it for electricity experiments.

An American named Benjamin Franklin also had cool ideas for batteries. In the 1740s, he made the “Franklin cell” using sheets of lead covered in wax paper, connected by brass hooks and salt water with acids. This produced more electricity than just salt water.

So why did scientists go to all this trouble to make batteries? Well, back then they were fascinated by electricity and wanted to study its effects. Batteries allowed them to produce steady electricity that could be conducted anywhere for experiments.

One famous use of early batteries was in 1800, when Volta made the first electric motor. He used a battery and copper wires to make the wire spin around continuously. This showed that electricity could be changed into motion.

Early batteries had some problems though. They produced low voltage and current. The chemicals were messy and dangerous to handle. The batteries didn’t last very long before needing new materials. Can you imagine having to rebuild your whole battery every time you wanted to use a device? Not fun!

Still, those first simple batteries eventually led to all the cool gadgets and rechargeable batteries we use today - flashlights, cell phones, even electric cars. So the next time you use your favorite toy or device, think about Volta and early scientists who experimented with batteries and electricity. They paved the way for our awesome gadgets that run on electricity!

## Glossary

- voltage - The force or pressure of electricity made by a battery. Measured in volts.
- acid - A chemical that produces positive hydrogen ions in water. Acids are corrosive.
- cell - A single unit that produces electricity from a chemical reaction.
