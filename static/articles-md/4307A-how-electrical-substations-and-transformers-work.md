# How Electrical Substations and Transformers Work

Hey kids! Did you know that electricity has to travel a long way before it can power up your video games and phones? It’s true! The journey starts at power plants where electricity is generated. From there, it travels along transmission lines to electrical substations in your neighborhood. Substations are like the pit stops that help electricity complete its journey to your home.

Inside a substation, some really cool equipment called transformers change the voltage of electricity. Voltage is the strength or pressure that pushes electricity through power lines. Transformers lower the voltage so electricity can be used safely in homes and businesses. Without substations and transformers, you’d get a nasty shock if you plugged anything into an outlet!

## How Substations Work

Substations have two main parts  the transmission side and the distribution side. On the transmission side, extra high voltage (EHV) electricity enters the substation on big transmission lines. EHV means the electricity has a voltage of 345,000 volts or more  that’s about 100 times more voltage than the electricity in your home! A volt is the unit used to measure electrical pressure.

The crazy high voltage is needed so the electricity can travel long distances without losing strength. It’s like a race car that needs a ton of gasoline to keep going at top speed for hundreds of miles. If the voltage drops too low before reaching a substation, the electricity wouldn’t have enough pressure to get to where it needs to go.

On the distribution side of a substation, transformers absorb the EHV electricity and reduce the voltage to under 35,000 volts. This lower voltage electricity then leaves the substation on smaller distribution lines and heads to neighborhoods.

## How Transformers Work

You’re probably wondering how transformers are able to lower electricity’s voltage. Believe it or not, they don’t have any moving parts or use any electricity! They work using the power of magnets.

Inside every transformer are two coils of wire wrapped around an iron core. Coils are loops of wire and the iron core helps concentrate the magnetic field. One coil is the input coil and the other is the output coil. The input coil gets the EHV electricity, changing the coil into an electromagnet. This creates a magnetic field in the iron core that the output coil picks up. The output coil converts the magnetic field back into electricity, but at a lower voltage.

It’s like a set of two communicating garbage cans connected by a tube. One can has water poured in representing the high voltage electricity. The water causes the first can to overflow into the tube where the second can receives it. But the second can is smaller so the water is now at a lower level, like the lowered voltage electricity!

Transformers work based on the ratio of coil windings between the input and output coils. More windings on the input coil than the output coil results in a lower voltage. Transformers can also increase voltage by having more windings on the output coil instead. This helps move electricity through the entire grid.

Substations and transformers are the unsung heroes of the electrical world. They work nonstop to deliver safe and usable electricity to homes and businesses. Next time you charge your phone or gaming device, take a moment to thank your neighborhood substation and its team of hardworking transformers!
