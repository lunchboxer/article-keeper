# Building wonders: Great architectural achievements of the past

Have you ever looked at a really tall building or a cool old bridge and wondered how people were able to build it? Throughout history, architects and engineers have come up with amazing ways to design and construct buildings and structures that seem to defy gravity. From the great pyramids of Egypt to the towering skyscrapers of today, these building wonders demonstrate how creative and resourceful the human mind can be.

The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is one of the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and arguably the most famous. Built around 2560 BC, it stood at an enormous 481 feet tall, and was the tallest manmade structure on Earth for over 3,800 years! The ancient Egyptians designed complex systems using ramps, levers and pulleys to be able to move the over 2 million massive stone blocks into place.

The Romans also had amazing engineering skills which they used to build architectural marvels like the Colosseum in 70 AD. This enormous amphitheater could seat 50,000 spectators who would come to watch gladiator fights, animal hunts, mock naval battles and more. The Colosseum had a complex system of underground rooms and passageways where gladiators, animals and equipment were kept. Huge sail-like awnings were used to shade spectators from the hot Roman sun.

Gothic cathedrals like Notre Dame in Paris used advanced architecture called flying buttresses which allowed cathedrals to have tall arched ceilings and stained glass windows. The flying buttresses held up the walls by channeling the weight to the outside rather than straight down. This allowed indoor space to open up and let in light. Many of these medieval cathedrals took over 100 years to complete.

The Eiffel Tower was a wonder of the modern age when it was built in 1889 in Paris, France. At 1,063 feet tall, it was the tallest building in the world at the time. It's still one of the tallest structures in Paris. The Eiffel Tower was built using puddle iron, a type of wrought iron that is very strong. It has two and a half million rivets holding the iron pieces together! The tower was only meant to stand for 20 years, but people loved its unique look so much it never came down.

Architects and engineers continue to push the boundaries of design and construction to build modern architectural wonders like Dubai's Burj Khalifa. At 2,717 feet tall it's currently the tallest building in the world! And who knows what amazing structures the future has in store. The human imagination certainly won't stop dreaming up and designing incredible building wonders.
