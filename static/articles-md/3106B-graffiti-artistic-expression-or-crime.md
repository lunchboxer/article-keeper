# Graffiti: Artistic Expression or Crime?

Graffiti is art or writing painted on walls, buildings, trains, or other objects and places. The people who make graffiti are called artists or taggers. Some graffiti is beautiful art. But other graffiti can be ugly and unwanted. What do you think about graffiti?

People have made graffiti for thousands of years. In ancient times, tribes drew pictures on cave walls. Some of these old cave paintings can still be seen today! People also made graffiti long ago in places like Pompeii and Egypt.

In the 1960s, graffiti got very popular again. Teens and young adults began using spray paint to write their names or draw pictures on city walls and subway trains. This was called "tagging." Tagging started in Philadelphia and New York. Some taggers were gang members marking their areas. Others were just kids showing their art.

Soon, graffiti art spread all over. By the 1980s, you could see it in big cities across America and Europe. Graffiti writing got more fancy. Taggers started adding cartoon characters, bubbles, and stylish letters. Their tags went from simple to very colorful and complex.

Some graffiti writers see tagging like a sport. They try to tag risky spots without getting caught. Others focus on being creative. Their paintings can be beautiful. Famous graffiti artists like Banksy make amazing street art that makes you think.

But many people see all graffiti as bad. Tagging can be dangerous. Taggers might sneak into train yards or climb tall buildings to spray paint them. Graffiti can also make signs and windows hard to see through. Cleaning up graffiti costs cities millions of dollars per year. And some graffiti promotes gangs or inappropriate things.

Laws say it's illegal to paint on public or private property without permission. Getting caught can lead to fines or jail time. But graffiti keeps happening anyway. So cities try finding legal ways for taggers to do art.

Some cities provide graffiti parks or "free walls." Here artists can paint legally. Cities also hire graffiti artists to paint murals. These colorful artworks help decorate neighborhoods. They also discourage illegal graffiti.

Do you think graffiti should be allowed? Or should all tagging be treated as a crime? How would you feel if graffiti showed up on your home or your school? People argue about how to handle these spray paint creations!
