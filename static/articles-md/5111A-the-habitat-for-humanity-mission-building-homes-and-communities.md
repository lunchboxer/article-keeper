# The Habitat for Humanity Mission: Building Homes and Communities

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you didn't have a home? For many families around the world, not having a decent place to live is a daily struggle. That's where Habitat for Humanity comes in!

Habitat for Humanity is an organization that helps build and improve homes for families in need. The mission of Habitat for Humanity is to put God's love into action by bringing people together to build homes, communities, and hope.

Habitat for Humanity was started in 1976 by a man named Millard Fuller. He and his wife Linda wanted to provide affordable housing for low-income families. They came up with the idea of asking volunteers to help build simple, decent houses that families could purchase with an affordable mortgage.

The first Habitat for Humanity house was built in Americus, Georgia in 1976. Since then, Habitat has built over 800,000 houses around the world! The organization uses donated money, materials, and volunteer labor to build and renovate homes.

When a family qualifies for a Habitat home, they partner with Habitat and put in hundreds of hours of "sweat equity." This means they help build their own house and the houses of other Habitat families. This makes homeowners feel empowered and gives them a sense of pride.

Building houses is just one part of Habitat's mission. They also build communities! Habitat brings together people from all walks of life to work toward a common goal. When a Habitat house is built, it takes the work of corporate sponsors, community volunteers, future homeowners, and most importantly, partner families. Building community is just as important as building homes.

Habitat for Humanity provides a "hand up, not a hand out" to families ready and willing to put in the hard work to improve their housing situations. Decent, affordable shelter helps create stability and new opportunities. It allows parents to focus on jobs and children to focus on education.

Owning a Habitat home is a dream come true for many hard-working families. It gives them strength, security, and joy. Home provides a foundation for life. Just ask the Lecaros family in Chile. Thanks to Habitat, the parents have steady jobs, the children get to go to school, and they have a safe, happy place to call home.

We can all be part of the Habitat mission. Through volunteering, donations, and spreading awareness, we build homes, communities, and hope. With decent housing, families gain dignity, safety and hope for the future. Just imagine what our world could look like if everyone had a decent place to live!
