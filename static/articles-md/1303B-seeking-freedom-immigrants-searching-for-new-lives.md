# Seeking Freedom: Immigrants Searching for New Lives

Every year, many people move to the United States from other countries. These people are called immigrants. They come here looking for better lives. Moving to a new country can be hard, but also exciting!

The United States has welcomed immigrants for a long time. For over 400 years, people have moved here from around the world. In the 1600s and 1700s, many came from Europe. In the 1800s, lots of Chinese workers moved to California. In the 1900s, immigrants came from Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

There are many reasons immigrants come to America. Many want jobs, education, or to be with family. Others are running from violence or unfair treatment in their home countries. Some just want the freedom to live how they want. America's values of freedom and democracy pull in immigrants.

The trip to get to America can be long and tough. Immigrants may travel hundreds or thousands of miles. They have to learn English, find jobs, and get used to American culture. But they think these struggles are worth it. They can build better lives here. Immigrants bring important skills, ideas, and cultures that make America richer.  

While moving to a new place is scary, immigrants are hopeful about the future. With hard work and not giving up, they can make their dreams come true. America is proud to be a country of immigrants, where people from all over can come together. The Statue of Liberty says "Welcome to your tired, your poor, your people wanting to breathe free."
