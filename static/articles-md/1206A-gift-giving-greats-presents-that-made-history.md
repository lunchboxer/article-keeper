# Gift-Giving Greats: Presents that Made History

Do you like giving and receiving gifts? People have been doing it for thousands of years! Some gifts end up being so special they change history. Keep reading to learn about some of the greatest gifts ever given.

Back in the olden days of Egypt, around 1279 BC, the Pharaoh Ramses II was given 21 baby lions by a ruler in Africa! Can you imagine getting baby lion cubs as a present? That would be a roaring good time! Ramses II loved to show off his pets. He even brought some lions with him to battle!

Jumping way ahead in time to the 1500s AD, Queen Elizabeth I of England received an unusual gift from Sir Walter Raleigh. As the Queen was walking down a grassy hill, Sir Walter took off his fancy coat and laid it down so she wouldn't get her feet muddy. What a gentleman! The Queen was very impressed. She made him part of her royal court after that charming gift.

Speaking of royalty, when Prince Albert married Queen Victoria in 1840 he gave her a snake bracelet as a wedding gift! It was made out of gold and had an emerald head. Victoria loved reptiles and wore the snake bracelet all the time. She even had a painting done showing it off on her wrist. What a hip hiss-toric gift!

We've talked about queens getting some crazy gifts, but sometimes presents are given out of kindness. In 1869, a man named St. Nicholas wanted to help a poor family who didn't have money for the daughters' wedding dowries. So he secretly threw three bags of gold coins into their house on three nights! This inspired the legend of Santa Claus and his midnight gift deliveries.

Of course, presents aren't always about money. Words can be gifts too! In 1865, the great president Abraham Lincoln gave a speech that ended slavery in America. The Gettysburg Address was short but powerful. It was a gift of freedom for millions of people.

Some gifts make scientific breakthroughs possible. The Rockefeller Foundation funded the development of penicillin in the 1920s to help people recover faster from illnesses and wounds. Thanks to their gift, this life-saving medicine still helps millions each year!

In more recent times, some pretty spectacular gifts have been given too. In 1981, the actress Elizabeth Taylor received a giant diamond necklace from her husband Richard Burton for her 40th birthday. The necklace cost over $1 million but Burton could easily afford it after they starred in Cleopatra together. Wow, what a sparkly gift!

As you can see, gift-giving has been huge throughout history. From pets to jewels to inspirational words, gifts are a way for people to express love, generosity, and appreciation. So next time you give or receive a present, think about how it's part of this wonderful tradition!
