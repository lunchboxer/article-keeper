# Doctors Without Borders - Brave medical workers helping in crisis zones

Have you ever thought about what it's like to be a doctor who helps people all around the world? That's what the group called Doctors Without Borders does!

Doctors Without Borders is also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). This group sends doctors and nurses to give medical care to folks in very hard situations. MSF goes to countries that are extremely poor or just had something bad happen like war or natural disaster. They help people who can't get healthcare any other way.

A group of doctors from France started MSF in 1971. They believed everyone deserves medical care, even in emergencies like wars. So they decided to cross borders themselves to give that care! Today, MSF sends over 30,000 volunteers from countries all over the world to more than 70 countries each year.

What does it take to volunteer with MSF? First, you need to be a doctor, nurse, or other medical expert. MSF volunteers are also really flexible people ready to drop everything and go where they are most needed. Volunteers work long, tiring hours in very difficult conditions. It can be extremely hot or bitterly cold where MSF works. The situations MSF is in can also be emotionally hard, so volunteers need to be strong-willed. But MSF volunteers say helping people who really need it is extremely rewarding.

MSF projects around the world focus on different kinds of care. When wars start, MSF sets up hospitals at the front lines to care for people hurt while fighting. After natural disasters like earthquakes, MSF rushes emergency medical supplies and doctors to give urgent care. MSF also works long-term in countries with diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. They run clinics, hand out medications, and give people vaccines.

MSF depends on donations so all their medical care can be completely free. This allows MSF to treat anyone who needs help, even where folks can't pay for care. MSF's rules say they must help anyone, no matter who they are.

Some MSF projects are extra risky because they are in war zones. Sadly, some volunteers have been injured or even killed while working. But thousands of new volunteers join MSF each year to continue their important work. After all, MSF's motto is “so others may live.” For these selfless doctors and nurses without borders, saving lives makes the risk worth it.
