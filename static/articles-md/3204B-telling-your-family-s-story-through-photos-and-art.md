# Telling Your Family's Story Through Photos and Art

Looking at old photos of your family can be really fun! The photos show what life was like for your grandparents and great-grandparents when they were little. Making art projects together as a family is also super cool. You get to use your imagination and make something special.

Let's start with the photos! Ask your parents if you can look at the old photo albums or boxes they keep. Some might be real printed pictures. Others could be digital photos saved on the computer or phone. Look through the photos with your family. Ask them to tell you about the people and places in the images.

* Who are those kids playing tag in the yard? Oh, that's Aunt Kelly with the frog in her pocket!
* When was this taken? A trip to the state fair in 1962 to get cotton candy as big as your head!
* Where is this vacation picture? At the Grand Canyon from a fun road trip!

Your family will share all kinds of stories when they see the old photos. They'll laugh about silly things they remember from long ago. Seeing the photos might even make them a little teary-eyed and happy.

Be sure to write down who, when, and where for each picture. This will help you put together a timeline of your family's history.

To make it even more fun, video interview different family members. Ask them to share their favorite childhood stories. Or have them show you something they liked to do as a kid, like a hand clapping song. Adding video makes the history really pop!

Now let's get creative! Work on an art project with your family to save a piece of their history. Here are fun ideas:

* Draw a family tree with photos of relatives and facts about them.
* Make a cardboard model of the neighborhood where your grandparents grew up. Use craft supplies like clay, glue, and markers.
* Make a poster by gluing down family pictures and items like tickets and postcards.
* Paint a picture of a place your family lived long ago, like great-grandpa's apple orchard.

Pick a project you and your family will enjoy. While you make your art, talk about memories from when your relatives were little. They'll have as much fun crafting with you as you will learning their history!

Display your photo collection and art in your home. When you walk by, you'll be reminded of your family's story. One day, you can pass down the photos and crafts to your own kids. That's how families stay connected from one generation to the next!
