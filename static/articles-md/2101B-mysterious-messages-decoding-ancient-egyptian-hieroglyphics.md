# Mysterious messages: Decoding ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics

Have you ever tried to read a secret code? It can be hard to figure out at first. Long ago in Egypt, people wrote in a code called hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics used pictures and symbols instead of letters.

The ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphics for over 3,000 years. Hieroglyphics were carved on temple walls, statues, pots, and scrolls made of papyrus. The Egyptians used them to write about gods, kings, history, science, and stories.

When you look at hieroglyphics, they seem like a bunch of silly pictures. But each picture and symbol stands for a specific word or sound. Once you know what they mean, you can read the messages!

For hundreds of years, no one could make sense of the hieroglyphic code. Then, in 1799, a French soldier found a big stone slab. This famous stone is called the Rosetta Stone. It changed everything.

The Rosetta Stone had the same message written 3 ways: In hieroglyphics, in another Egyptian script called Demotic, and in Greek. Scholars used the Greek words as a cheat sheet to figure out the hieroglyphs.

Thanks to the Rosetta Stone, people could finally read hieroglyphics. This helped them learn more about ancient Egypt. Today, reading hieroglyphics is an important skill for Egyptologists.

Here are what some hieroglyphs stand for:

- A bird is the letter A
- A mouth is the letter R
- An owl is the sound M
- A bunny means "to be"
- A sun is the sun god Ra
- A cobra is protection

There are some tricky rules:

- Hieroglyphs can go left-to-right or right-to-left
- Vowels are left out a lot
- Symbols mean different things based on context

With practice, you could decode hieroglyphic messages too! What secrets might they share?
