# The Meaning and Messages in Surreal Art

What is surreal art? Surreal art tries to show objects or scenes that you would not normally see together in real life. The word “surreal” means unreal, strange, and dream-like. Surreal artists use their imagination to create art that looks fantastical, unrealistic, and unexpected. Their art is filled with surprise, humor, and mystery.

One famous surrealist artist is Salvador Dalí. He painted melting clocks, floating fruit, and dreamy landscapes. Dalí said his art shows the subconscious mind. That is the part of the mind with hidden thoughts, feelings, and memories. His paintings have hidden meanings and symbolism.

For example, Dalí’s painting The Persistence of Memory shows melting clocks in an odd landscape. The melting clocks represent how time feels different in dreams compared to waking life. This shows Dalí’s interest in dreams and the subconscious mind. The odd landscape represents the irrational scenes in dreams.

Another famous surrealist artist is René Magritte. His paintings often show ordinary objects in strange settings. For example, his painting The Son of Man shows a man with an apple covering his face. The setting is a room with an open window to a cloudy sky. This unrealistic scene makes us think about identity, reality, and illusion.

Surreal art encourages us to use our imagination. It shows us magical worlds where anything is possible. Surreal art also encourages us to look deeper. The odd images and combinations of objects have hidden meanings to discover. Surrealism teaches us to look at things in new and creative ways.

Next time you see a melting clock or an umbrella with legs, you will recognize the playful style of surreal art! What funny and fantastical art will your imagination dream up?
