# How Power Grids Connect Us to Electricity

Every time we turn on the lights or plug in our video games, we're using electricity that comes from the power grid. The power grid is a big system that brings electricity to our homes and schools from power plants that make it. Let's learn how it works!

The power grid has three parts. First, power plants make the electricity. Next, big transmission lines carry it far away. Then smaller wires share it with our buildings.

## Making the Electricity

At power plants, special generators are spun very fast. This makes electricity! Some plants use wind, water, or sun to spin the generators. Others burn natural gas or coal to make steam that spins them.

The electricity starts out at a low voltage, or force. So transformers at the plant boost the voltage. That makes the electricity stronger for its long journey on transmission lines.

## Carrying the Power

Now the electricity travels on huge transmission lines. These are tall metal towers with thick wires on top. They carry electricity at high voltages for hundreds of miles.

On the way, the electricity stops at substations. Transformers there lower the voltage before it goes onto smaller wires for our neighborhoods.

## Bringing it Home

Finally, the lower voltage electricity is carried on distribution lines. These are the wood poles and wires you see on local streets. They take electricity to buildings in towns and cities.

From the street wires, service lines bring the power right to each building's electrical panel. The panels make the voltage even lower for use in homes and businesses.

And that's how the power grid takes electricity from big generators at plants and shares it all around through wires above ground and below! It's like a giant highway system for electricity.

## Glossary

- voltage - the force or pressure of electricity in wires
