# Mapping it out: The history of cartography and navigation

Have you ever wondered how people long ago found their way around without getting lost? They used maps and compasses! Let's explore the history of mapmaking and navigation.

A long time ago, there were no GPS or Google Maps. Early explorers used simple maps to travel to new places. The first maps were made thousands of years ago by people like the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese. These old maps helped them remember where important landmarks and borders were.

The first compasses were made in China about 2000 years ago. Early compasses weren't used for navigation. They were actually fortune telling tools! But by the 1100s, sailors used compasses to sail safely. Compasses helped sailors know which way was north, south, east and west. This let them navigate even when they couldn't see land or stars.

During the Age of Exploration starting in the 1400s, European sailors used compasses to sail to Africa, Asia and the Americas. Good maps were very important for these long voyages across oceans. Mapmaking improved a lot so sailors could navigate better.

During the Renaissance, mapmaking got much better. New tools like the telescope helped explorers figure out their location at sea using latitude and longitude. Maps became more realistic with more details.

Today, mapmakers use cool technology like satellites, aerial photography, and computer software. This allows them to make accurate 3D maps that show landscapes, buildings, roads, and more. Apps like Google Maps can track your phone's location anywhere using GPS!

Mapping continues to evolve. New systems like GIS let us collect and analyze geographic data. Scientists even make maps of outer space! The future of navigation looks out of this world.
