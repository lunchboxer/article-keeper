# Hydro-electric dams: Generating power from water

Have you ever wondered where the electricity comes from that lets you turn on lights? A lot of it comes from special power plants called hydro-electric dams. Dams use the power from flowing water to make electricity in a super neat way. Keep reading to find out how!

## How a Dam Works

A dam is built across a river by blocking the water with a huge wall. This makes a big pool of water called a reservoir behind the dam wall. Near the bottom of the dam wall is the intake. Gravity makes the water flow down through the intake from the higher reservoir to the lower river on the other side. The moving water spins giant turbines inside the dam which are hooked up to generators. The generators change the spinning motion into electrical power. This electricity then travels through wires to homes, schools, and businesses nearby to give power for lights, appliances, and devices.

## Why Dams Are Useful

Dams are great because they give a steady supply of electricity by trapping the strong power in flowing water without burning fossil fuels. This makes hydro-electric energy cleaner for the environment than power plants that burn coal, oil, or natural gas. Dams are also renewable since they count on water cycles which refill river flows. Once built, a dam can provide energy for many years. The reservoirs that dams form offer fun activities like boating, swimming, and fishing too.

## How Building Dams Impacts Animals

Making a new dam and reservoir does change the natural habitat and impact wildlife in the area. The rising reservoir water can flood forests and fields where animals live. Some animals may move homes or struggle to adapt to the habitat changes. Fish like salmon can also be blocked from swimming upstream to lay eggs. But engineers try to plan dams to minimize impacts on animals and plants. Fish ladders are often added to dams which make a path for fish to safely go upstream.

## Major Dams in America

The U.S. has over 80,000 dams, but only a few hundred are big dams for hydro-electric power. The Hoover Dam on the Colorado River is one of the largest in the U.S. At 726 feet tall, this curved concrete dam powers over 1 million homes in three states! Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington state makes the most electricity in the U.S., giving power to 11 states. Other major dams are Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona and Kentucky Dam between Kentucky and Illinois. Dams give about 7% of total electricity made in America.

So the next time you flip on a light, think about the amazing dams that use the force of flowing water to brighten our lives! Dams are engineering wonders that provide clean renewable power for our world.
