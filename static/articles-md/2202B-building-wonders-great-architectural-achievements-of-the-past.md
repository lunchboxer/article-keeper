# Building wonders: Great buildings people made long ago

Have you ever looked way up at a super tall building or an old bridge and wondered how people built it? People long ago came up with really smart ways to design and build structures that seem to stick to the sky. From the huge pyramids in Egypt to the giant skyscrapers we have today, these building wonders show how creative and skilled the human brain can be.

The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is one of the coolest old structures ever made. Built around 2560 BC, it was 481 feet high, and the tallest thing people had ever built for over 3,800 years! The ancient Egyptians used ramps, levers and ropes to move the huge heavy stone blocks and put them in just the right spots.

The Romans also knew how to make amazing buildings like the Colosseum in 70 AD. This giant outdoor arena could fit 50,000 people who came to see gladiator fights, hunts, and fake sea battles. The Colosseum had many underground rooms and tunnels where gladiators, animals and stuff were kept. Huge shade cloths were used to block the hot sun for the people watching.

Gothic cathedrals like Notre Dame in Paris used special building called flying buttresses. These allowed the cathedrals to have tall arched ceilings and colorful stained glass windows. The flying buttresses held up the walls from the outside instead of straight down. This let the inside space open up and light come in. It took over 100 years to finish many of these big medieval churches!

The Eiffel Tower was an amazing modern structure when built in 1889 in Paris, France. At 1,063 feet high, it was the tallest building in the world then. It’s still one of the highest points in Paris. The Eiffel Tower was made using strong iron with 2.5 million metal rivets holding it together! It was supposed to only stand for 20 years, but people loved its look so it never came down.

Architects and engineers keep trying to build taller and more amazing modern structures like Burj Khalifa in Dubai. At 2,717 feet high it’s the tallest building now! Who knows what awesome things will be built in the future. People will keep dreaming up and designing unbelievable building wonders.
