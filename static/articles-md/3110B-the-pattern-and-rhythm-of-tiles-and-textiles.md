# The Pattern and Rhythm of Tiles and Textiles

When you look around your home or school, you probably see lots of tiles and textiles. These are materials that make up many everyday objects. If you look closely at them, youâ€™ll notice they have some very cool patterns!

Tiles are used to cover floors, walls, counters, and even roofs. Long ago, artists carefully designed beautiful patterns on tiles. Some use shapes like squares, triangles, and hexagons repeating over and over. Others show pictures of plants, animals, or people.

The tiles in your bathroom may just be plain white. But famous buildings around the world have amazing tile art inside. The Blue Mosque in Istanbul has thousands of handmade tiles that make up its decorations.

Textiles are types of cloth and fabric. Things like clothes, towels, blankets, and tapestries are made from textiles. Weaving allows for many different textures and designs. By changing the color and spacing of the threads, unique patterns can be formed.

Some patterns use straight lines, like stripes, plaids, and checks. Other patterns copy shapes in nature, like flowers and vines. More abstract patterns play with curves, dots, and symmetry. Symmetry means one half matches the other half exactly.

Traditional textiles from places like Peru, India, and Native American tribes often have patterns with cultural meaning. A Navajo blanket might have diamond shapes that represent mountains.

Next time you walk on a tile floor or cuddle up in a cozy blanket, look for repeats in the patterns. See how they use small shapes over and over. Notice how the patterns seem to move before your eyes, like the rhythm of a song!

So tiles and textiles all around us have some math and history inside their patterns. Paying attention to their designs can be fun!
