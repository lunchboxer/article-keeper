# Parades, Pranks, and Parties: Crazy Ways to Celebrate

People sure have some nutty ways to party! From parades to jokes, here are some kooky celebrations from around the world.

## Mardi Gras in New Orleans

Mardi Gras is a huge party in New Orleans. Every year, over 1 million folks come to celebrate before Lent. Lent is the 40 days before Easter when some people give up treats.

The party starts with wacky parades. People dress up in silly costumes and toss beads to the crowd. There are bands, dancers, and colorful floats. Some parades even have famous people!

After the parades comes lots of yummy Cajun food like jambalaya, étouffée, and king cake. Cajun food is spicy and tasty. Folks eat, listen to music, and dance up a storm. Laissez les bons temps rouler means "let the good times roll" in French. And good times roll at Mardi Gras!

## April Fools' Day Jokes

Get set for some foolish fun on April 1st! April Fools' Day is for playing tricks and jokes.

In Scotland, they celebrate "Hunt the Gowk Day." Gowk means cuckoo bird. People try to fool each other by sending them to find things that aren't real!

In Portugal, folks try to stick paper fish on each other's backs without getting caught. The fish are for the gullible fish who get tricked.

One silly April Fools' joke was about spaghetti growing on trees! In 1957, a news show fooled people into thinking you could grow your own spaghetti trees. People called wanting to plant their own! What a noodle-head joke!

## Songkran Water Festival

Cool off at the world's biggest water fight! Songkran is the Thai New Year in April. People party by splashing water to wash away bad luck from the old year.

The water fun lasts three whole days! Folks soak strangers with water guns, buckets, hoses, and balloons. There are also parades with people in traditional clothes.

At night, people float lanterns on rivers. Lanterns are decorations around a light. They use the lanterns to make wishes.

The water craziness keeps going with foam parties. People spray thick, white foam instead of water! Talk about a bubbly bash!

## Las Fallas in Valencia

Get ready for Las Fallas, Spain's loudest party! Las Fallas means "the fires" in Spanish.  

Every March, huge cardboard statues pop up in Valencia. Some statues are as tall as buildings! They are called ninots. The ninots poke fun at famous people and leaders.  

After a week of parades, fireworks, concerts, and paella feasts, they set the ninots on fire! On the last night, the ninots blaze in a giant bonfire. People also light their own crackers for a noisy, fiery end! Now that's one red-hot party!

From parades to pranks, people sure have nutty ways to celebrate! What wacky ways would you party? Use your imagination to think up your own kooky celebration!
