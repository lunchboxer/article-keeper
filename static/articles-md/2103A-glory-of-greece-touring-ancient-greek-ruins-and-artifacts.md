# Glory of Greece: Touring ancient Greek ruins and artifacts

Imagine going back in time over 2,500 years to ancient Greece! What would it be like to walk around the same streets and buildings as people like Socrates, Plato, and Alexander the Great? Though we canâ€™t actually time travel, we can visit many of the incredible ancient Greek ruins and see the artifacts that have survived to this day. Grab your imagination, walking shoes, and sense of adventure as we explore some of the most amazing sites of ancient Greece!

One of the most famous ruins is the Acropolis in Athens. Perched on top of a hill overlooking the city, the Acropolis contains ancient Greek temples that were built around 500 BC. The most well-known temple is the Parthenon, with its towering columns and elaborate carvings. Walking up the steps of the Acropolis feels like stepping back in time as you gaze at the magnificent ruins and try to picture what they looked like thousands of years ago.

Not far from the Acropolis is another awesome site - the Ancient Agora! This was like an ancient Greek downtown with shops, temples, and a central meeting place. Here philosophers like Socrates and Plato would have given speeches and debated ideas with other thinkers. The ruins have a magical feeling, almost as if their voices still echo in the air.

Greece has ruins located all over the country. On the island of Delos you can explore the remains of a whole ancient Greek city! Wander around temple ruins, a theater, streets lined with houses, and the famous Terrace of the Lions. This is also the legendary birthplace of the twin gods Apollo and Artemis.

No tour of ancient Greek ruins would be complete without a visit to the site of the first Olympic Games - Olympia! Founded in 776 BC, the Olympics were held here every four years. Explore the ancient stadium and temples where athletes once competed. You can almost picture the roar of the crowds cheering on their favorite sports over 2,000 years ago!

In addition to ruins, many ancient Greek artifacts have also survived, giving us a glimpse of ancient Greek art and culture. Some of the most well-known artifacts are sculptures like the Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace. Others include painted vases with intricate scenes of mythology, gods, and everyday life. Mosaics, jewelry, coins, and bronze statues are also on display.

Visiting the ruins and artifacts of ancient Greece is an incredible way to connect with the past. As you walk around sites where legendary figures once stood and gaze upon objects they made and used, history comes alive! So pack your bags and get ready for an unforgettable adventure back in time to ancient Greece!
