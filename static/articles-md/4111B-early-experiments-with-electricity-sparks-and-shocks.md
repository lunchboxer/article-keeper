# Early experiments with electricity: Sparks and shocks

Have you ever gotten a zap from a doorknob after walking on carpet? That's static electricity! People found out about static electricity a very long time ago. But they took a long time to learn how to use electricity on purpose.

Way back in ancient Greece around 600 BC, thinkers like Thales noticed something. If you rub amber with cloth, it picks up bits of straw! They called this 'electricity' after the Greek word for amber, 'elektron'. But electricity was just an odd thing for hundreds of years.

In the 1600s, scientists started really testing static electricity. In England, a doctor named William Gilbert rubbed lots of stuff. He found out which ones made the most static electricity. He knew insulation helps keep charges.

A German named Otto von Guericke went further. In 1660 he made a machine that used a spinning sulfur ball. It made giant sparks over 2 feet long! He had parties where sparks zapped between people's noses and hands.

Benjamin Franklin joined in 1749. With his famous kite in a storm he showed lightning was electricity too. This led him to make the lightning rod to protect buildings. Franklin also invented words like ‘battery’ and ‘electrician’ we use today.

In the late 1700s an Italian scientist Luigi Galvani zapped frog legs to twitch with metal. Soon after, Alessandro Volta built the first real battery called the voltaic pile. Now scientists had steady currents, not just little zaps.

In 1800, Humphry Davy used the pile to pass current through thin strips of metal. This made the first electric arc light. It was so bright it hurt eyes! Arc lights were later used in lighthouses and towns.

By the 1830s, Michael Faraday made electricity a science. He introduced electromagnetic fields. Faraday invented the first electric motor and generator too.

Faraday’s work started the age of electricity. Over many years, scientists transformed electricity. What was once just sparks in labs became a new power that changed the world. The first pioneers probably never imagined that!
