# How lodestones were used as compasses centuries ago

Long before GPS and smartphones, ancient explorers used lodestones to help them find their way. Lodestones are special rocks with natural magnetic properties that allow them to align with the earth's magnetic field and point north. For centuries, lodestones were prized as primitive compasses that could help navigators travel across land and sea.

The history of lodestones goes back over 2000 years. Chinese writers described lodestones and their special powers as early as the Han Dynasty around 200 BC. Back then, lodestones were called "love stones" because of the seemingly magical attraction they had to one another. Later on in medieval Europe, lodestones became known as "leading stones" because of their ability to lead and guide travelers.

So how exactly did these mysterious rocks work? Lodestones contain a mineral called magnetite that makes them into natural magnets. They have two poles, "north" and "south", just like the earth. When freely suspended, the lodestone's north pole will swing around and point north towards the Earth's north magnetic pole.

To make a compass, ancient craftsmen would take a slab of lodestone and carve it into a thin needle shape. They would gently heat the needle and allow it to cool while pointing north-south. This would magnetize the stone even more. To protect the delicate magnetic needle, it would be floated on water or carefully balanced on the point of a metal pin. Then, explorers could observe which direction the stone needle turned to find their bearing.

Lodestone compasses changed exploring and sailing. Before the compass, crews had to stay close to land and use the sun or stars to navigate. With this new technology, ships were able to brave long journeys out of sight from shore. One famous explorer, Zheng He, led Chinese fleets on several expeditions into Southeast Asia and Africa in the 1400s using lodestone compasses.

However, lodestone compasses also had some disadvantages. Their minerals would slowly realign to the magnetic pull of the metal ship they were carried on. This meant readings had to be constantly corrected. They were also vulnerable to interference from iron objects. And magnetic north does not align perfectly with true geographic north. Still, for centuries lodestones were one of the main ways for travelers to find their bearings when navigating unfamiliar terrain.

These days, explorers rely on modern electronic compasses and GPS instead of lodestones. But this ancient magnetic rock continues to fascinate geologists. Next time you use a compass or phone to find your way, remember the lodestone that started it all!
