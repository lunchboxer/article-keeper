# Whistleblowers - Exposing wrongdoing at great risk

Have you ever seen someone doing something wrong, but were too afraid to tell on them? It takes a lot of bravery to speak up when you know something bad is happening. People who take that risk are called **whistleblowers**. They help expose secrets and lies that hurt people.

Whistleblowing means calling attention to unethical or illegal activities. It helps stop corruption, fraud, and harm. Powerful companies or governments often try to hide their bad deeds. Whistleblowers risk their careers and sometimes their lives to reveal the truth.

Famous American whistleblowers include Daniel Ellsberg, Jeffrey Wigand, Sherron Watkins, and Edward Snowden. Ellsberg, a military analyst, leaked secret documents about the Vietnam War in 1971. Known as the "Pentagon Papers," they showed the public how much the government had lied about the war. Ellsberg faced charges of stealing government property, but his leaks helped end U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

Jeffrey Wigand was a tobacco company executive. In 1996, he exposed how cigarette makers intentionally made their products more addictive and dangerous. Wigand lost his career but helped hold Big Tobacco accountable. His story was told in the movie "The Insider."

Enron was a huge energy company that committed massive accounting fraud. Sherron Watkins was an Enron executive who tried to report the crimes. When that failed, she contacted journalists. Her tips brought down top Enron leaders.

More recently, Edward Snowden leaked secret NSA documents in 2013. They revealed how the government spies on its own citizens. Snowden fled to Russia to avoid U.S. prosecution. Some call him a traitor, but others view him as a champion of citizens' rights.

What makes someone blow the whistle? Most do it because they believe honesty protects the public. They think exposing wrongs is more important than keeping secrets. Many first report problems internally through "proper channels." If nothing changes, they might then turn to the media. Effective whistleblowing relies on credible evidence, not rumors.

There are serious risks to whistleblowing. Powerful wrongdoers often attack the messenger rather than address the message. Whistleblowers can face harsh criticism or lose their job. Some even get death threats. Governments might charge them with crimes for revealing classified data. For example, Snowden faces U.S. charges of espionage and theft of government property.

To protect and encourage whistleblowers, some countries have passed laws. These shield employees who disclose misconduct from retaliation. In the United States, the Whistleblower Protection Act tries to safeguard federal whistleblowers. Private companies are also required to permit anonymous reporting of unethical acts.

Still, most agree that more protection is needed. Whistleblowers endanger themselves to protect the public good. Their bravery can reform broken systems and remind us to do what's right, not what's easy. As the old saying goes, "sunlight is the best disinfectant." Whistleblowing shines light on society's darkest corners.
