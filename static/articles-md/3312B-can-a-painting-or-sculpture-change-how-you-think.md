# Can a Painting or Sculpture Change How You Think?

Art can make us feel and think in new ways! Paintings and sculptures are more than pretty pictures or cool statues. Great artworks can change how people see the world. Next time you go to an art museum, think about how the art makes you feel. You might be surprised!

Some famous artists want their art to inspire people. They use art to share ideas. For example, Pablo Picasso painted people and things in odd, new ways. This made people question what was normal or beautiful in art.

Other artists use color to share moods. Look at paintings by Mark Rothko. His huge paintings have bold reds, oranges, and yellows. To many people, Rothko's art feels full of energy and emotion. The colors stir up strong feelings.

Sculptures can also challenge ideas and cause reactions. Imagine seeing a giant metal spider! The big spider sculpture called Maman would shock you! It looks real but is strange and huge. This sculpture challenges our normal ideas about beauty in art.

Some sculpture artists want to start talks about political or social issues. For example, the artist Ai Weiwei uses art to share about human rights issues in China. One famous work is a giant snake made of kids' backpacks. It highlights children dying in building collapses from an earthquake. The huge snake makes people think about the country's corruption and innocent lives lost.

Public art in everyday places reaches many people. In Denver, Colorado, a massive blue bear sculpture welcomes travelers. This fun, friendly bear called I See What You Mean makes people smile. It shows how public art adds joy and personality to cities.

So next time you see great paintings, sculptures, or public art, think about how it affects you. Does it make you happy, upset, or curious? Does it start new ideas in your mind? Remember, art can change how we think and feel! Keep an open mind to art's power!
