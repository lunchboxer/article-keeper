# Super Silly Doodles: How to Draw Funny Faces

Do you want to learn how to draw silly faces? It's easy and fun! In this article, you'll find tips to make funny faces.

Let's start with the head. Draw a big circle or oval. This is the face shape. Add a smaller circle under it for the chin.

Now draw two circles up top for eyes. Leave room to add details later.

Drawing crazy hair makes your characters look silly. Try spikes, loops, zigzags or shapes. Color with neon or rainbow colors!

Eyes can be stars, hearts or fun shapes - not just circles. Add dots, swirls and squiggles inside the eyes. Use zigzags or spikes for the eyebrows.

The nose can be any shape - squares, stars or circles work. Add dots, stripes or plaid. You can give your character an animal nose too!

Next is the mouth. Big smiles with lots of teeth are funny. Pointy or square teeth work. Stick out the tongue. Make the mouth a fun shape and size.

Once you have the basics, add glasses, hats, ribbons, face paint and other fun details. Use patterns, shapes and colors that make you smile!

When your silly face is done, add a funny caption. Use speech bubbles and thought bubbles. Write funny words and phrases.

Use your imagination to draw silly faces! Start with shapes, then add wacky colors, details and accessories. With practice, you'll make hilarious characters in no time!
