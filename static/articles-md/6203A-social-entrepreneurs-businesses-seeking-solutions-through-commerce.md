# Social Entrepreneurs - Businesses seeking solutions through commerce

What do you want to be when you grow up? A doctor? A teacher? An astronaut? How about a social entrepreneur? Social entrepreneurs use business to make the world a better place. They see problems in the world and try to fix them by starting companies.

Social entrepreneurs focus on more than just making money. They want to help people and the planet too. For example, Blake Mycoskie started a shoe company called TOMS Shoes. For every pair of shoes he sold, he gave a pair to a child in need. He has given away over 60 million pairs of shoes!

Some social entrepreneurs try to help the environment. Lauren Gropper started Repurpose, a company that makes bowls, plates, and utensils from recycled materials. This reduces waste and keeps plastics out of landfills and our oceans.

Other social entrepreneurs work on solving big health problems. Kate Cheney started a company called NovaBone to help people with bone injuries heal faster. The company uses technology to make special bone replacements in their labs.

Still other social entrepreneurs focus on creating jobs and supporting workers. Greyston Bakery in New York makes delicious brownies and cookies. But they also provide jobs and job training to people who have struggled to find work.

As you can see, social entrepreneurs view business as a tool to drive social change. They come up with clever ideas to make money and help people at the same time.

Some common ways social entrepreneurs give back include:

- Donating goods - For every item purchased, they donate a similar item to someone in need. TOMS Shoes works this way.

- Hiring underserved groups - They make an effort to hire and train people who have barriers to employment. Greyston Bakery operates this way.

- Using eco-friendly practices - They develop products and services that are environmentally sustainable and reduce waste. Repurpose makes recycling cool!

- Investing profits in their cause - They reinvest their earnings to grow their social mission instead of just making money for investors.

Social entrepreneurs face challenges too. It's not easy to run a successful business while also pursuing ambitious social goals. But with hard work and innovation, social entrepreneurs will continue dreaming up new ways to make money and change lives.

Maybe you will become a social entrepreneur someday too! The next time you drink lemonade from a lemonade stand, think about how refreshing it is to buy something that also supports a good cause! We all can make a difference in this world.
