# No place like home: Housing through the ages

Your home is where you and your family eat, sleep, and relax. Homes can look very different! Long ago, people's homes were much simpler. Let's learn how houses have changed over time.

First, cavemen lived in caves. Caves kept them safe from the weather and wild animals. Later, they used sticks, skins, and mud to build basic huts.

Some olden days people were nomads. Nomads moved around to find food. They lived in tents that were easy to carry with them.

In hot places, the first real houses were mud huts with straw roofs. In cold climates, people built log cabins from tree trunks.

Many years ago, ancient Egyptians started making brick homes. They also built gigantic pyramids for their kings and queens.

The ancient Greeks constructed pretty white buildings with columns. The ancient Romans built aqueducts to carry water and huge arenas like the Colosseum.

In the Middle Ages, most people in Europe lived in tiny, dark cottages. But wealthy lords had big castles made of stone.

When America was new, settlers lived in small log cabins. Later, wooden frame houses were popular.

In the 1900s, cozy bungalow homes appeared. Bungalows had low roofs and big front porches. New electric things like lights and stoves changed life at home.

Nowadays you can find all kinds of houses. In the future, homes might use solar power instead of electricity. Robots could help build houses too! But there's no place more special than your own home.
