# Wacky wave power: Capturing ocean energy

The ocean is filled with energy! Waves, tides, and currents all contain kinetic energy that can be captured and turned into electricity. Converting the power of the ocean into usable energy is called wave power. Wave power is renewable, which means it can't run out. Let's dive into the wacky ways we can harness the motion of the seas.

One type of device used to capture wave power is called a point absorber. It's a giant buoy that bobs up and down on the surface of the water as waves pass by. The bobbing motion drives an internal generator that converts the kinetic energy of the waves into electrical energy. Point absorbers are simple and low cost, but they produce less power than other designs.

Another device called an oscillating water column uses waves to push air in and out of a hollow concrete or steel tube. The forced air spins a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity. Oscillating water columns can efficiently capture energy from waves coming from multiple directions. Big wave power plants may have dozens of oscillating water columns lined up offshore.

There are even wilder ways to squeeze power from the sea! One totally gnarly design is a snake-like series of floating tubes. As waves cause the joints between the tubes to bend back and forth, the motion is used to pressurize water. The high-pressure water gets sent through a turbine to spin a generator. This snake wave power device looks totally crazy but it works!

Surf's up for wave power technology! Engineers keep cooking up new ways to harness the boundless energy in the ocean. Wave power could provide clean, renewable electricity to coastal communities around the world. Catching waves is a righteous way to generate energy without pollution. Cowabunga!
