# Youth Activists - Kids making a difference in the world

Around the world, young people are speaking up and taking action to make a positive difference. From climate change to social justice, today's youth are passionate about causes they care deeply about. While adults often underestimate the power of youth, many kids are proving that they can create real change, even at a young age.

## Greta Thunberg - Climate activist

One of the most well-known youth activists today is Greta Thunberg from Sweden. At just 15 years old, she began protesting outside the Swedish Parliament to demand action on climate change. Her solo protest soon inspired other students around the world to join her in school strikes calling for change. Greta's message that adults must take responsibility and listen to scientists has ignited a global movement of youth climate activism. She has spoken forcefully at the United Nations, met world leaders, and continues to be a leading voice for climate justice.

## Mari Copeny - Clean water advocate

Mari Copeny, also known as Little Miss Flint, is a young clean water advocate from Flint, Michigan. After learning that many kids in her community didn't have access to clean drinking water, she wrote a heartfelt letter to President Obama asking for help. The letter went viral, prompting Obama to visit Flint and provide aid. At just 10 years old, Mari has now raised over $500,000 to provide water filters and bottled water for Flint residents. She continues to speak out until every home in Flint has clean water.

## Marley Dias - literacy promoter

When Marley Dias was just 11 years old, she was frustrated by the lack of diversity in her school's curriculum. So in 2016, she launched a project called #1000BlackGirlBooks to collect and donate children's books featuring black female protagonists. Her goal was to collect 1,000 books, but the campaign went viral and exceeded that number in just a few months! Marley has now donated over 13,000 books to schools and community centers around the world to promote literacy and representation. She shows no signs of stopping, even making appearances on Ellen and other major TV shows.

## Other young changemakers

There are countless other young activists making waves worldwide. Levi Draheim, 12, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government for failing to address climate change. Nkosi Johnson, who passed away at 12, fought for the rights of HIV/AIDS victims in South Africa. Melati and Isabel Wijsen, 12 and 10, convinced Bali to ban plastic bags. The list goes on! It's clear that with passion and perseverance, kids can be powerful forces for change.

So next time someone says "you're just a kid," remember all of the amazing youth activists out there proving that young people can make a real difference!
