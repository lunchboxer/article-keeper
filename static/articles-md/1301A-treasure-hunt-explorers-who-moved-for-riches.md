# Treasure Hunt! Explorers Who Moved for Riches

Yo ho ho! Do you like the idea of sailing the seas in search of buried treasure? Many brave explorers did just that. They risked their lives traveling to faraway places hoping to strike it rich. Grab your pirate hat and eye patch, and let's learn about some of history's most daring treasure hunters!

In the 1500s, the Spanish conquistadors were some of the first Europeans to explore the Americas. Conquistadors like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro chased rumors of golden cities full of treasure. When they arrived, they found magnificent civilizations like the Aztec, Maya, and Inca. But instead of seeking friendship, the conquistadors conquered these people to seize their gold and silver riches. Not very nice! But their quest for treasure opened up the Americas to European settlement.

Three hundred years later, the California Gold Rush lured thousands of "forty-niners" west in covered wagons. These scrappy adventurers panned for gold nuggets in rivers or dug deep mines in the earth. People got rich quick by striking "color" (finding gold). But most missed the mother lode and went bust. Still, their trailblazing helped America expand all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

Jumping ahead to the 1900s, we meet daring archaeologists like Howard Carter and Hiram Bingham. Carter uncovered King Tut's ancient Egyptian tomb filled with golden artifacts. And Bingham rediscovered the Incan city of Machu Picchu high in the Andes Mountains. While hunting lost ruins, these explorers revealed fascinating cultures and made scientific discoveries.

Whether seeking Aztec gold or Incan silver, these fortune hunters let their wanderlust and greed drive them to unlikely places. They braved harsh terrains, fierce natives, and other dangers for a chance at a big payday. Some struck it rich, others went home empty-handed. But their risky voyages helped map the world and uncover lost civilizations. Ahoy! That's the end of our treasure trail. Hope you enjoyed this swashbuckling adventure through history!
