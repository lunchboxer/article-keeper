# Pure poetry: The history of writing and literature

Writing is so important - we use it every day! But people haven't always written the same way they do now. Writing and reading have changed a lot over time. Let's take a look back at how writing began.

A very long time ago, before paper and pencils, people drew pictures on cave walls to tell stories. They used things like charcoal from fires and juice from berries as paint. Even without letters, these cave paintings were an early kind of writing.

Over many, many years, ancient civilizations created the first real writing systems. In Mesopotamia, people called Sumerians pressed wedge shapes into wet clay to make cuneiform. In Egypt, hieroglyphics with little pictures were carved into stone. And in China, calligraphy was painted using ink and brushes. These were the first alphabets and letters!

Later, around the 1400s, an amazing machine was built - the printing press. This let people make lots of copies of books and newspapers very quickly, instead of slowly writing them by hand. Books could now be shared with many more people. Writers became famous, like William Shakespeare who wrote plays in England and Mark Twain who wrote Huckleberry Finn.

Nowadays we have so many ways to write! We can send email and text messages from phones, type on computers, and write stories on paper. The next time you read or write something, think about how writing has changed over time. Who knows, maybe you'll create an important new way of writing someday too!

The most important thing is that writing lets us share ideas and learn from each other. So grab a pencil and start writing - the page is yours!
