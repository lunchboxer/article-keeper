# Strange Tales of Lightning Strikes and Their Effects

Have you ever been outside in a big storm? You might have seen the sky flash with lightning! Lightning is one of nature’s biggest forces. Let’s read about some odd stuff it can do.

There was a man named Roy Sullivan who lived in Georgia. He worked in a park where he got hit by lightning not just once...but seven times! After so many zaps, Roy got the nickname “Human Lightning Rod”. That’s a lot of shocking strikes for one guy!

Lightning can leave funny marks on your skin called Lichtenberg figures. These look like branch shapes. They happen when the electricity spreads out under the skin. The weird patterns usually disappear after a while. Some folks even get these lightning scar shapes tattooed on themselves!

There is a flat mountain far away in Venezuela called Roraima. The rocks at the top have tons of zig-zag lines carved into them. From above, the marks look like a big fingerprint! Scientists think these curves were zapped into the stone by many lightning bolts. Wow!

Lightning doesn’t just hit living things and mountains. Once, it hit a toilet while a man was using it in Florida! The zap went through the pipes and gave him a jolt up his bottom - yikes! He was okay, but I bet he won’t use that bathroom in a storm again!

Lightning can look different colors like blue, red, or purple as it flashes. This happens from gases and bits of dust that the bolt moves through. Next time there’s a storm, keep watch for rainbow lighting!

Here’s a crazy fact - lightning even happens on other planets! Jupiter has huge lightning storms that are a thousand times stronger than Earth’s! Other planets like Venus, Saturn and Neptune may also have electric storms. Imagine seeing lighting on another world! However it strikes, lightning sure can do peculiar things.
