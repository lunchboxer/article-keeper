# When Composers and Librettists Create Together: The Making of Operas

Operas are fun shows that have singing with music from an orchestra. It takes a team to make an opera. The most important jobs are the composer and the librettist.

The composer writes all the music for the opera. This includes the songs, choruses, and instrumental parts. The librettist writes all the words for the opera. This is called the opera **libretto**. The libretto has the lyrics, dialogue, and story.

First, the librettist writes the libretto. This tells the whole story with words. Then the composer uses the libretto to create the music. The composer picks melodies, rhythms, and harmonies that match the story's moods. The composer also writes the instrumental parts for the opera orchestra.

Writing an opera takes a long time! The composer and librettist work on it for months or years. They change and fix parts until they are happy. The opera gets better each time they revise it.

Once the opera score and libretto are done, the opera gets produced. Singers, musicians, directors, and costume designers turn the opera into a show on stage. The composer and librettist often help with this too.

Finally, the new opera is performed for the first time at its premiere. The audience gets to enjoy the exciting show that the composer and librettist created together! Famous operas they made this way include *The Magic Flute*, *La bohÃ¨me*, and *Porgy and Bess*.

Maybe you can compose or write the libretto for a new opera someday! What would your opera be about?
