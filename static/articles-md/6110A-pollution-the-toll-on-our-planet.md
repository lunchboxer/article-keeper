# Pollution: The Toll on Our Planet

Pollution is a big problem on our planet. Factories, cars, and people create pollution every day. This pollution hurts plants, animals, and even people! Let's learn about the different types of pollution and what we can do to help stop it.

## Air Pollution

Air pollution happens when gases, dust, fumes and smoke get into the air. Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil makes a lot of air pollution. Factories and power plants burn fossil fuels and create polluted air. Cars, trucks and buses running on gasoline and diesel also pollute the air. Even things like spray cans and hairspray create air pollution!

Breathing polluted air can make people sick. It can cause asthma attacks and lung diseases. Polluted air also creates smog which makes it hard to see clearly. Acid rain is caused when pollution mixes with rain, and this harms plants and trees.

We can help stop air pollution by walking and biking more instead of driving. We can also ask our parents to drive electric cars which don't use gasoline. Factories and power plants should use filters to clean the air before it comes out of their smokestacks.

## Water Pollution

Water pollution is caused when trash, chemicals, and other wastes get into lakes, rivers, oceans and other water. Factories sometimes dump chemicals right into waterways. That's illegal because it poisons the water! Even soap and dirt from washing our cars can flow into storm drains and pollute nearby water.

Oil spills from ships hurt fish and birds. Fertilizer from farms and lawns washes into rivers and streams, causing too much algae to grow. This algae uses up oxygen that fish need to breathe. Sewage and litter cause diseases and can close beaches.

We can help stop water pollution by using less fertilizer on lawns. Fix oil leaks from cars and don't dump oil or chemicals down storm drains. Pick up trash and recycling so they don't blow into the water. Ask adults to use phosphate-free detergent which won't pollute as much.

## Land Pollution

Land pollution happens when people throw trash directly onto the ground instead of into proper waste bins. Things like plastic bottles, bags, cans, and cigarette butts often end up as land pollution. When it rains, this litter washes into waterways and causes pollution there too. Rotting food, diapers, and animal waste also pollute the land if not cleaned up properly.

Landfills are where our garbage goes, and these take up more and more land. Rotting trash in landfills also leaks chemicals into the soil and groundwater. We can help stop land pollution by reducing the amount of garbage we create. We can recycle, compost food waste, and avoid products with too much packaging. We can also make sure to put all trash into proper bins instead of littering.

By learning about pollution, we can help keep our planet clean and healthy. Small things we each do every day, like biking instead of driving, recycling, and using less fertilizer really do make a big difference! Our planet gives us so much, so it's our job to take good care of it.

## Glossary

- fossil fuels - Coal, oil and natural gas formed underground from dead plants and animals over millions of years. Burning fossil fuels creates air pollution.

- asthma - A lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. Pollution can cause asthma attacks.

- sewage - Waste water that contains feces, urine and other contaminants from homes and factories. Improperly treated sewage pollutes water.

- fertilizer - Chemicals added to soil to help plants grow. Too much fertilizer washing into rivers and lakes causes overgrowth of algae.

- phosphate - A mineral found in some detergents and fertilizers. Too much phosphate getting into waterways causes pollution.
