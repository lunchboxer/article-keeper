# Disasters and Danger: Moving to Avoid Catastrophe

Some places get hit by big storms and disasters more than others. Knowing what could happen where you live can help you stay safe if something bad comes.

## Big Storms in Some Places

Different parts of America see different kinds of big storms. Places by the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean sometimes get hit by hurricanes. Hurricanes have very strong winds, lots of rain, and flooding. States in the middle like Oklahoma and Kansas get more tornadoes. Tornadoes are fast spinning funnel clouds that come down from thunderstorms. They can wreck homes and buildings.

In California, earthquakes shake the ground when pieces of the earth's crust move. This happens along fault lines like the San Andreas Fault. Flooding happens a lot in states like Florida and Louisiana when heavy rain fills up rivers fast.

Big storms also happen outside America. Typhoons hit countries in Southeast Asia. Typhoons are the same as hurricanes. Japan can have earthquakes, tsunamis (big waves from under the ocean), and volcanoes since it sits on the "Ring of Fire" around the Pacific Ocean. No place is completely safe from disasters.

## Moving to Stay Safe

When people learn their home could see more disasters, some decide to move. After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans very badly in 2005, over 100,000 people left. Others worked to make their houses safer for big storms. They put homes up on stilts or made walls and roofs stronger. In earthquake places, strapping down heavy stuff keeps it from falling and hurting someone. Knowing what could happen in your area helps you get ready.

## Watching the Weather

New tools help warn people about coming storms. Scientists can see hurricanes forming over the ocean many days before they hit land. They warn people when tornadoes might happen so they can take cover. Flood and tsunami warnings tell people to go to high ground.

We can't totally stop disasters. But technology helps lower the risks. Paying attention to weather reports on TV or the radio could save lives. If told to evacuate or take shelter, do it! This keeps more people safe when something bad strikes.
