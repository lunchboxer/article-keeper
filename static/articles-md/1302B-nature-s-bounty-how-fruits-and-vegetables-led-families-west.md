# Nature's Bounty: How Fruits and Vegetables Led Families West

In the 1800s, many families traveled west in covered wagons. They wanted to start new lives on the frontier. But why did so many people take the long, hard trip west? Fruits and vegetables were a big reason!

In early America, most fruits and veggies came from Europe. Oranges and lemons were very expensive. People mainly ate potatoes, cabbage, and onions. Farmers grew crops like wheat and corn.

Then in the 1820s, farmers started growing apple and peach trees. They planted more vegetables too, like tomatoes, corn, and squash. With all these yummy fruits and veggies, America didn't need imports from Europe anymore!

As orchards and farms spread west, news spread too. Pioneers heard about the rich, fertile soil out west. After cold winters of plain food, juicy peaches and ripe tomatoes sounded wonderful!

Going west was risky, though. The trip covered over 2,000 miles of mountains and deserts. Many pioneers died on the harsh journey. Those who made it found a hard life building homes and farms.

But the orchards and farms they planted did very well in the fertile soil. Some pioneers wrote home about pumpkins as big as washtubs! With hard work, pioneers achieved their dream of a good new life. Their fruits and vegetables helped them prosper.

The pioneers' letters, books, and diaries told of the amazing crops on the frontier. Their stories inspired more pioneers to go west. They wanted their own land to feed their families. The fruits and veggies on the frontier were a key reason pioneers went west.

So next time you eat a juicy apple or fresh tomato, think of the pioneers. They traveled west for the chance to grow delicious fruits and vegetables. Led by nature's bounty, pioneers like the Donner party braved the trip west!
