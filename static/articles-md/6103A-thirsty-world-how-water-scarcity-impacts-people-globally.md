# Thirsty World - How water scarcity impacts people globally

Water is one of the most important natural resources on Earth. All living things need water to survive, including humans, animals, and plants. But many people around the world do not have access to clean, safe water. This is called water scarcity. About 2.2 billion people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water. That's almost 1 out of every 3 people!

Water scarcity happens for a few different reasons. In some places, there just isn't a lot of freshwater available. Only about 3% of the world's water is freshwater. The rest is salt water in the oceans. In other places, water is polluted by trash, chemicals, or waste. Polluted water can make people sick if they use it for drinking, cooking, washing, or farming.

Climate change is also causing more droughts in some areas of the world. Droughts are long periods of time with less rain than normal. With less rain, there is less freshwater available for people to use. Climate change is also causing some glaciers to melt. Glaciers are giant sheets of ice. When glaciers melt, the freshwater they provide also goes away.

One country facing extreme water scarcity is Yemen. Yemen is located in the Middle East on the Arabian Peninsula. It has been suffering from a civil war since 2014. This war has made access to clean water even more difficult. 20 million people in Yemen do not have enough clean water. As a result, Yemen is also experiencing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history. Cholera is an illness that causes severe diarrhea. It spreads through contaminated water. More than 2 million people in Yemen have gotten sick from cholera since 2016.

In Cape Town, South Africa, a long and severe drought almost left 4 million people without water. Starting in 2015, the region received very little rain for 3 straight years. The government warned Cape Town residents that they were months away from "Day Zero". That was the day when no more water would come out of the taps. People lined up for hours to collect water from public springs. Schools and businesses had to shut down. Finally in 2018, the drought came to an end. Cape Town narrowly avoided running out of water completely.

People living with water scarcity must travel long distances to collect water. This keeps kids out of school. It also prevents parents from working. Contaminated water causes diseases that keep people from living healthy, productive lives. Access to clean water provides opportunities for education, health, and economic growth.

What can be done to help provide more clean freshwater to people in need? Building wells, dams, and systems to harvest rainwater are all part of the solution. Conservation and protecting water sources from pollution are also key. Most importantly, the world needs to work together to make solving the global water crisis a priority. With smart solutions and determination, we can make clean water more available so all people can thrive.
