# Playful Plots: The Stories Behind Holiday Characters

Holidays are full of fun traditions. Many holidays have special characters that are part of the fun. Let's look at where three of these characters came from. 

Santa Claus brings gifts on Christmas Eve. But Christmas wasn't always about Santa. A long time ago there was a kind man named Saint Nicholas. He lived in Greece and liked to give gifts to people. This made him very popular! After Saint Nicholas died, people celebrated him on December 6th. They told stories about him and his generosity. 

When immigrants came to America, they brought these stories with them. Over time, the stories changed. Saint Nicholas turned into Santa Claus! Now Santa lives at the North Pole. He has elves that make toys and a magic sleigh pulled by flying reindeer. 

Reindeer don't really fly, but people used to believe they did! In ancient Siberia, people fed reindeer special red and white mushrooms. Then they would collect and drink the reindeer's urine. They thought this gave them magic powers! This could be why we tell stories about Santa's flying reindeer.

Santa also wasn't always pictured the way he is now. Early drawings by an artist named Thomas Nast first gave Santa his red suit and white beard. Before that, poems described Santa as "a right jolly old elf." Today, Santa's look is known all over the world!

Another holiday character is the Easter Bunny. Rabbits are signs of spring and new life. Long ago in Germany, stories were told about a special "Easter Hare." When Germans moved to America in the 1700s, they brought this tradition with them. 

Eventually the Easter Hare became the Easter Bunny. The bunny hides colorful eggs for kids to find on Easter morning. Rabbits don't actually lay eggs, but the Easter Bunny brings the magic of the holiday.

Finally, we have the Halloween Jack-o’-Lanterns. Jack-o’-Lanterns are pumpkins carved with spooky faces and lit with candles. But who was "Jack" in the first place?

One story says there was a stingy Irishman named Stingy Jack. Jack tricked the devil to get out of paying for his drinks. When Jack died, he wasn't allowed into heaven or hell. He had to wander around with only a turnip and coal to light the way. 

Irish immigrants came to America and brought this tale with them. They used to carve turnips like Jack's. When they found pumpkins, they realized those were much easier to carve. So Jack's turnip became the pumpkin Jack-o'-Lantern!

As you can see, many holiday characters have interesting stories behind them! Immigrants brought these traditions to America. Over time, the tales changed into the characters we know today. So the next time you see Santa, the Easter Bunny, or a Jack-o’-Lantern, remember their playful plots and origins!
