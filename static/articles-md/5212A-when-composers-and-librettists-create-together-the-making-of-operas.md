# When Composers and Librettists Create Together: The Making of Operas

Have you ever wondered how amazing operas are created? Operas are exciting theatrical productions that combine singing with orchestral music. Creating an opera takes teamwork between composers who write the music and librettists who write the words.

The composer and librettist must work closely together. First, the librettist writes an opera **libretto**, which is the text or script that contains all the words that will be sung by performers. Librettos tell dramatic stories and include dialogue and lyrics for songs.

After the librettist finishes the libretto, the composer uses it to write the opera's musical score. The composer decides how to set the libretto to music. Composers choose melodies, rhythms, and harmonies that match the emotions and events in the story. They write instrumental parts for the opera orchestra too.

Writing an opera can take many months or even years! The composer and librettist revise their work many times before finishing. They add, remove, tweak, polish, and improve it until they are both satisfied.

Once the opera score and libretto are complete, the hard work isn't over. Next, opera companies produce and perform the new opera onstage. The opera gets cast with singers and orchestral musicians. Stage directors and costume designers bring the opera to life visually. Often, composers and librettists stay involved to oversee the production.

On opening night, the opera finally premieres in front of a live audience! All the effort pays off when the performance moves, excites, and entertains the crowd. The creative partnership between composer and librettist results in a stirring work of opera art.

Some famous operas created through great composer-librettist partnerships include *The Magic Flute* by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Emanuel Schikaneder, *La boh√®me* by Giacomo Puccini and Giuseppe Giacosa, and *Porgy and Bess* by George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward. Which operas will you compose and write in the future?
