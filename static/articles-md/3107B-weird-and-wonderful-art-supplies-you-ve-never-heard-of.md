# Weird and Wonderful Art Supplies You've Never Heard Of

Hey kids! Are you bored of using the same crayons and markers over and over? There are so many odd and fun art supplies out there you probably don’t know about! Read this to find out about some of the strangest stuff you can use to make art. Your projects will be more exciting when you use these!

## Coffee

You can paint with coffee! When coffee dries, it leaves pretty brown stains on the paper. To use it, make some coffee and let it cool off. Get a paint brush and start painting! Try making the coffee lighter or darker to get different shades of brown. It's way more fun than boring brown paint!

## Metal

Metal isn't only for sculptures! Some artists use metal flakes or powders to give their art a cool, glittery metal look. Different metals like copper, bronze and aluminum make different colored glimmers when used in paint. Try mixing metal paints with normal paints to get a shiny, sparkly result.

## Dirt

Nature gives some of the best art supplies. Plain old dirt from your yard can make pretty earthy art. Some artists use dirt right from the ground by grabbing handfuls and rubbing it on paper. Others mix it with paint or glue to get different textures and colors. If you don’t want to get messy, just collect dirt in jars to use. Get creative with nature’s art supplies!

## Twigs

Along with dirt, twigs from the ground can make nature art. Glue down a bunch of twigs to make a textured background for a painting. Or, paint fun designs right onto twigs to create special paint brushes! You can also dip twigs in paint to make prints. They make perfect thin lines and curvy shapes.

## Ketchup

Here’s a sauce you won’t find in an art store – ketchup! The red ketchup is a fun choice instead of red paint. Squirt it right from the bottle onto paper or mix it with other paints to make new colors. It looks smooth and shiny when dry. Drizzle or splatter ketchup to add excitement to your art!
