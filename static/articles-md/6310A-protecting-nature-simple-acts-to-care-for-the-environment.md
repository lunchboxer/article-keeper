# Protecting Nature - Simple acts to care for the environment

Taking care of the environment might seem like a big job, but there are lots of simple things that kids can do every day to help protect nature and wildlife. Here are some easy ways you can make a difference right in your own neighborhood!

## Use Less Water

When you turn on the faucet or take a shower, think about how much water you are using. Try timing your shower and seeing if you can get it down to 5 minutes or less. Turn the water off while you brush your teeth. Make sure faucets are completely turned off so they don't drip. Using less water helps conserve this precious resource.

## Recycle and Reuse

Instead of throwing away plastic bottles, cans, paper and other recyclables, be sure to put them in the recycling bin. Check if there are recycling programs at your school too. Reuse items like plastic containers or bags instead of throwing them out. The more we recycle and reuse, the less trash ends up in landfills.

## Plant a Garden

Growing your own fruits, vegetables or flowers is fun and helps the environment! Planting native plants that are suited to your area provides food and habitat for local wildlife like birds, butterflies and bees. Having your own garden means less need for trucking produce long distances to stores.

## Ride Your Bike

Biking or walking instead of driving reduces pollution and carbon emissions from cars. It's also great exercise! See if you can bike or walk to school, a friend's house or activities instead of relying on parents for rides.

## Pick Up Litter

When you see trash on the ground, don't just walk by - pick it up! Litter harms wildlife and makes our neighborhoods look messy. Get your family or friends together for a litter clean-up day in your community. Taking care of the environment starts right outside your door.

## Turn Off Lights

Don't leave lights on in rooms that you aren't using. Make sure lights get turned off when you leave a room. Using less electricity reduces the amount that power plants have to produce, which cuts down on air pollution.

Protecting nature and wildlife might seem hard, but when we all pitch in with simple acts every day, it makes a big difference. Our planet provides the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat - so it's up to all of us to take care of it!
