# How Your Culture and Values Shape Your View of Art

What you think about art can depend a lot on where you come from. Your culture and values can change how you see and make art!

Let's pretend there are two kids - Jamie from Japan and Maria from Mexico. If they visited an art museum together, they might like totally different paintings!

Jamie might like the gentle paintings of nature best. In Japan, art often shows quiet scenes from nature. This fits with Japanese values like being subtle and living with nature. Maria might love the colorful, exciting folk art paintings more. Mexican folk art has lots of bold patterns and vibrant colors. It shows values like expressing feelings and celebrating community.

Or imagine Jamie and Maria listening to music. Soft flute songs might make Jamie feel calm. Loud mariachi bands with guitars and trumpets might pump Maria up. Their culture influences how music affects their moods.

When Jamie and Maria make their own art, their backgrounds shape what they create. Jamie might paint a peaceful lake scene for art class. Maria might paint a fun village with lots of people dancing. Their choice of what to paint and how shows their different cultures.

The country you grow up in shapes your view of art. But so does your family! Picture Jamie has one sister. Maria has five brothers and sisters. Jamie might often make art alone quietly at home. Maria might make art in a loud, busy scene with all her siblings! Their experiences as kids in their families lead to different art styles.

Your community matters too. Jamie might see tidy gardens with flowers in rows. Maria might see big colorful sunflowers spilling out of pots everywhere. These sights around them get worked into their art.

As you can see, your culture and childhood affect how you experience and create art in big ways! Next time you see or make art, think about where you're from. Your background changes how you see art in many ways!
