# Reducing Waste - Tips for minimizing your environmental impact

Hey kids! Do you want to help protect the environment and reduce waste? Small changes in our daily habits can make a BIG difference. Here are some easy tips to reduce the amount of trash we create:

## Bring Your Own Bags

Plastic shopping bags are used for just a few minutes but can stick around for hundreds of years. Next time you go shopping, bring a reusable bag. This cuts down on plastic waste. Cloth bags are best, but even reusable plastic bags work. Decorating your bags makes them easy to spot at the store.

## Skip the Straw

Americans use over 500 million straws every single day! Straws are one of the top ocean pollutants. When possible, skip the straw or bring a reusable one made of metal or silicone. Your drinks will taste the same, and fish and sea turtles will thank you.

## Recycle Right

Recycling helps keep waste out of landfills. Check if your town recycles paper, plastics, glass, and metals. Make sure to rinse food off containers before recycling. Keep different types of recycling separated and put bins in easy-to-use places at home.

## Bring a Reusable Water Bottle

 bottles of water produce tons of plastic waste each year. Carry a reusable bottle and fill it up at water fountains instead of buying disposable plastic bottles. Try different styles like aluminum, stainless steel, or BPA-free plastic. Don't forget to wash regularly!

## Pack a Waste-Free Lunch

Disposable lunch items like plastic baggies, foil, and sandwich wraps get tossed after one use. For less waste, pack lunch in reusable containers. Use a lunchbox or bag instead of paper bags. Bring cloth napkins and metal utensils from home. Taking just a little extra time prepares a lunch thatâ€™s kinder to the planet.

## Buy in Bulk

Buying in bulk with reusable containers uses less packaging than individually wrapped items. Visit stores where you can scoop pasta, cereal, or snacks into containers you bring from home. Bulk foods are often cheaper too! Just buy what you need to avoid waste from buying too much.

Following these tips will reduce waste and make the environment a little cleaner. What other ideas do you have? Working together, our small actions create big change. The earth and future generations will thank you!
