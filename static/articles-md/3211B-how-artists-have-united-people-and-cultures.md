# How Artists Have United People and Cultures

People everywhere love art! Artists make paintings, songs, dances, and stories that bring us together. Their art helps us learn about other places. When we share art, it can make us all feel like one big family.

Even long ago in the Stone Age, people made art. In France, there are ancient cave paintings of woolly mammoths. In Egypt and Greece, artists made statues of their gods. China had beautiful paintings on silk scrolls. All around the world, art was part of special ceremonies.

Different cultures used art to understand each other. About 800 years ago, Spain was ruled by Muslim leaders. Jewish, Muslim, and Christian artists worked side by side. They shared ideas and made awesome art and poetry together.

During the Renaissance, great artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci made amazing paintings and sculptures. People still go to Italy to see their art. Fun dances like the Volta also spread from Italy across Europe.

Later, European countries took over much of the world. But soothing art, like Monet's peaceful Water Lilies paintings, helped people. And jazz, which started in the U.S., brought people together.

Today the internet lets us share art fast with the globe. Artists mix styles and work online together. Music, comics and dances from Asia have fans everywhere. Art reminds us we have more in common than we think!

So next time you hear a catchy song from another land or read a good story, think about how art links us as one big, colorful family.
