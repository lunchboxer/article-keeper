# The Great Pacific Garbage Patch - How plastic trash swirls in a huge ocean vortex

Imagine a huge ocean vortex filled with plastic bottles, bags, toys, and all kinds of trash. This swirly garbage soup stretches across hundreds of miles of the Pacific Ocean. Scientists call it the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. How did it get there? Where does all that junk come from? What can we do about it? Let's dive in and explore the Great Pacific Garbage Patch!

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch formed in an area called the North Pacific Gyre. This is a slow spiraling current between Hawaii, the US west coast, Japan, and Russia. The circular motion traps floating debris. Over many years, the trapped plastic trash built up into a giant swirling plastic soup.

Most of the garbage comes from people littering and garbage blown from landfills. Plastic doesn't biodegrade or break down over time. Instead, it photodegrades. This means the sun's UV rays break plastic into tiny pieces called microplastics. They're often too small to see with the naked eye.

The patch was discovered in 1997 by sailor and researcher Charles Moore. He was shocked to see so much plastic waste floating in the ocean. The patch is now twice the size of Texas! Scientists estimate the Great Pacific Garbage Patch contains over 80,000 tons of plastic. Yuck!

The plastic pollution causes big problems for sea life. Sea turtles, seals, fish, and birds often get tangled in plastic debris. They can also mistake plastic bits for food. Animals that eat microplastics may get sick and die.

People have tried using boats to scoop up the floating plastic trash. But the patch is massive and the plastic pieces are spread out and keep breaking into smaller bits. Thankfully, we can all help reduce the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by using less single-use plastic. Bring reusable bags when shopping. Choose products with less packaging. And always recycle plastic when possible. Small changes can make a big difference to keep plastic out of our oceans!
