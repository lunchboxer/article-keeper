# Wireless charging: Electricity transmitted invisibly

Have you ever gotten annoyed when your phone or tablet runs out of battery power? You have to find a charger and plug your device in to charge it up. It sure would be nice if you could charge your devices without wires! Well, guess what? Some smart engineers have invented a way to charge devices wirelessly using a new technology called inductive charging. Let’s learn how it works!

Inductive charging allows electricity to be transmitted between two objects that are not physically connected. A charging station sends out an electromagnetic field. This means it sends out waves of energy that we can’t see. When a device that is enabled for inductive charging is placed on the charging station, a current is induced in the device. Current means the flow of electricity. So the charging station induces or creates electricity to flow in the device, charging up its battery!

One of the cool things about inductive charging is that electricity flows between the charger and device even though they are not plugged in. The charger just has to be close enough to create an electromagnetic field that the device can receive. It’s like magic - charging your phone without having to fumble for cords and plugs!

Inductive charging has been around for over 100 years, but has recently become popular for charging consumer electronics. One of the first uses was to power devices implanted in someone’s body, like a pacemaker. Some electric toothbrushes also use inductive charging stations to recharge.

Nowadays, you can buy charging pads to place your phone on to charge it up. Many new smartphones support inductive charging. The most common standard is called Qi, pronounced “chee.” Any phone or charger that supports the Qi standard will work together. Qi charging pads often let you simply drop your phone on them and charge several devices at once.

Some furniture, cars, and public places are adding inductive charging built right in. For example, you could charge your phone by placing it on a nightstand, cafe table, or car dashboard that has inductive charging built in. IKEA sells lamps, bedside tables, and desks with inductive charging stations built into the surface. BMW has offered wireless car chargers since 2015. Starbucks has built them into some table tops at their stores.

One limitation of today’s inductive charging is that the device has to be close to the charger - usually touching it. In the future, we may have remote wireless charging that works from across the room! Companies are developing technologies that use infrared lasers to send power to devices from meters away. These could let you power your phone from a charger on the other side of a room. Amazing!

Wireless charging is very convenient and will likely continue to grow in popularity. In a few years, we may no longer have to plug in our devices at all! We’ll just drop them on a charging surface or even charge them remotely. No more wires and plugs to mess with. The next time your phone or tablet dies, just look for a wireless charging spot to give it some juice!
