# Kids' life long ago: How children lived in ancient times

Have you ever wondered what life was like for kids a long, long time ago? Believe it or not, children's lives in ancient times were very different from kids' lives today!

In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, most kids did not go to school. Only the children of wealthy families got to study reading, writing, math, and other subjects. The children of poor families started working as young as age 5 or 6. Boys often worked with their fathers doing farm work or learning a trade like stonemasonry or carpentry. Girls helped their mothers cooking, cleaning, and taking care of babies.

Even though they worked hard, ancient kids still found ways to have fun! Egyptian children played with toys like dolls, toy soldiers, balls, spinning tops, and board games. Greek kids loved playing games too, including leap frog, tug of war, hide and seek, hoops and sticks, and knucklebones (a game with stones that's a bit like jacks).

Clothes were very different back then too. In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, most kids wore simple tunics or dresses made from linen or wool. Shoes were uncommon - most kids went barefoot. Only wealthy children wore jewelry, fancy hairstyles, and elaborate outfits.

There weren't any cars or buses, so if they traveled, ancient kids rode in carts pulled by donkeys, horses, or oxen. Most people lived and worked on farms, so kids didn't travel far from home. A trip to a marketplace in a nearby village would have been very exciting!

Food was healthier in some ways than today. There were no sugary sweets or sodas. Most kids ate fruits, vegetables, eggs, cheese, and bread they grew or produced themselves. But there were no supermarkets - droughts and famines were common, so poor families often struggled to find enough food.

Life expectancy was much lower back then, so childhood illnesses and injuries that are easily treatable today were often fatal. Families were big, with 5 or more kids, but high infant mortality rates meant only a few children might survive to adulthood.

While kids' chores, clothes, food, and schools were different in the ancient world, they still laughed and played just like you. Thinking about how kids lived long ago shows that while some things change over time, the spirit of childhood stays the same!
