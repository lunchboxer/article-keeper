# Roads lead to Rome: Journeying on ancient Roman roads

Over 2000 years ago, the ancient Romans built a massive network of roads across Europe. These roads helped them control their huge empire and move their armies quickly. Let's take an imaginary journey on these ancient roads to learn more about how the Romans traveled!

Our journey starts in Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire. From here, stone roads stretch out in all directions, like spokes on a wheel. Some lead north to modern-day England. Others head east through Greece or south to Africa.

The roads are very straight and flat, to make travel easier. Miles and miles of paved stone mean no bumps or mud holes to get stuck in! Stone bridges cross rivers and canyons along the way.

As we walk down the road, we pass milestones every 1,000 paces. That's about one mile. These stone columns tell how far we are from Rome. Milestones help travelers know where they are.

On the side of the road we see waystations every few miles. At these rest stops, travelers can get fresh horses, food, and a place to sleep. Waystations make the long journey much easier.

After a few days of walking, we spot a stone archway up ahead. This arched gateway marks the entrance to a city. Cities and towns often built these decorative arches beside roads leading in.

Inside the bustling city we see shops, temples, theaters, and more. People crowd the streets selling food, pottery, fabrics, and animals. Cities were built along the Roman roads, which allowed goods and news to travel quickly across the empire.

Leaving town, we continue our journey down the stone road. Up ahead is a troop of Roman soldiers marching. Their metal armor clanks as they walk. The roads allow Romans to quickly move their strong armies wherever they are needed.

The Roman roads truly connect their vast empire. On our imaginary journey, we've seen how these amazing roads helped Romans travel, trade, and control their territory. They built an empire where all roads lead to Rome!
