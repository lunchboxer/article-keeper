# From Garage Startup to Tech Titan: The Evolution of Apple and Pixar

It's hard to believe that two of the world's most successful technology companies started out as tiny startups in a garage! Both Apple and Pixar began as just ideas in the heads of their founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak for Apple, and Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith for Pixar.

In 1976, Jobs and Wozniak began building early personal computers in the Jobs' family garage in Los Altos, California. At first, they sold hand-built computers directly to local computer hobbyists. Their first computer was called the Apple I. It didn't have a monitor or keyboard, just the basic circuit board. But techies saw the potential!

Soon after, Wozniak invented the Apple II, one of the first successful personal computers. It came with a keyboard and could display color graphics on a regular TV. The Apple II was a hit! In 1980, Apple Computer became a publicly traded company, making Jobs and Wozniak millionaires.

By 1984, Apple released their first Macintosh computer. With its graphical user interface, easy-to-use mouse, and suite of creative software, the Macintosh changed computing forever. Though Jobs left Apple in 1985, his vision and innovative spirit continued shaping the company's path to success.

Today, Apple is one of the world's largest technology companies, with sleek products like the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Macbooks. They revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and use technology in our daily lives.

Meanwhile in 1979, Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith were researching computer graphics and animation at the New York Institute of Technology. George Lucas recruited them to start the Graphics Group of Lucasfilm. Their goal was to create the first computer-animated feature film.

In 1986, Steve Jobs bought the Graphics Group from Lucasfilm and incorporated it as Pixar. It took years of technological breakthroughs, but in 1995 Pixar released Toy Story, the first full-length computer animated movie. Audiences were amazed by the stunning 3D graphics. Toy Story was a monumental success, grossing over $360 million worldwide!

Pixar Animation Studios went on to produce beloved family films like A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and more. Their films have earned billions of dollars and won dozens of Academy Awards. In 2006, Disney purchased Pixar, but it retained its identity, culture, and independent operations.

The evolution of Apple and Pixar prove that a big dream, persistence, and belief in innovation can take a simple garage startup to extraordinary heights. Their stories inspire young entrepreneurs today to envision what technology can achieve to connect people and tell amazing stories. The digital age owes much gratitude to the passionate pioneers of Apple and Pixar!
