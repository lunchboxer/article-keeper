# Yummy History: How Your Favorite Foods Link to Holidays

Did you ever think about why we eat fun foods on holidays? Many treats we look forward to each year have neat histories. Let's read about how some of your favorite holiday foods started!

## Turkey on Thanksgiving

Thanksgiving just isn't the same without a big roasted turkey! Eating turkey goes back to the first Thanksgiving party in 1621. The Pilgrims who sailed to America and the Wampanoag Indians got together to celebrate their first good harvest. Historians think they ate turkey, deer, fish, lobster, clams, berries, fruit, pumpkin, and squash. Since there were a lot of turkeys around, they became the main meal at future feasts.

## Candy Canes on Christmas

Candy canes are a yummy treat many kids hope to find in their stockings on Christmas day. But did you know candy canes may have religious beginnings? Some stories say a choir teacher in Germany made sugar sticks shaped like shepherds' canes to keep kids in his choir quiet during long church services. Others believe the shape is a "J" for Jesus. The red stripes were thought to be like Christ's blood.

## Hot Cross Buns on Good Friday

Have you tried these sweet, spiced buns with icing crosses? They are traditionally eaten on Good Friday, the Friday before Easter Sunday. Hot cross buns go back to medieval times in England. Monks baked and shared them with the poor on Good Friday. The cross on top was for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Queen Elizabeth I later banned hot cross buns except at Easter time.

## Mooncakes on Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival

The Mid-Autumn Festival is a big holiday in China that celebrates the fall harvest. Round mooncakes with sweet or savory fillings are traditionally eaten while spending time with family under the bright harvest moon. Mooncakes show family togetherness. The rich eggs and oil were thought to bring success for the next year. Sharing mooncakes under the full moon brings good luck according to legend.
