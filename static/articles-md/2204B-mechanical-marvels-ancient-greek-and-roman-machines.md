# Mechanical Marvels: Ancient Greek and Roman Machines

Let's take a trip back over 2,000 years ago to ancient Greece and Rome! The people who lived back then were super smart. They invented many cool machines even without electricity.

One Greek guy named Archimedes made a corkscrew machine that could move water uphill. It was called the water screw. This helped the Greeks get water to drink and to water their crops.

Archimedes also dreamed up giant mirrors that could focus sunlight like a laser beam. The mirrors could light enemy ships on fire! That would keep intruders away.

Other Greek inventors built huge weapons to attack enemy cities. They had tall towers called siege towers to climb city walls. They also swung giant logs called battering rams to smash down gates.

When the Romans took over, they became great engineers too. They built aqueducts to carry water to cities and sewers to get rid of waste.

The Romans invented the wheelbarrow to lug around heavy stuff as they built roads and buildings. In sawmills, they used water power to cut stone and marble with big circular saws. They ground up grain into flour using water-powered mills.

To lift giant blocks into place, the Romans used cranes and pulley systems with ropes and wheels. People or animals walking inside treadwheels provided the power!

The Romans also improved transportation. They built over 50,000 miles of roads so legions could march quickly through the empire. Mile markers helped travelers know how far they had gone.

On the seas, Roman ships had sails and banks of rowers to speed across the waves.

The machines of the Greeks and Romans made their lives easier and helped their empires grow strong. Their creative ideas still inspire our engineers today!
