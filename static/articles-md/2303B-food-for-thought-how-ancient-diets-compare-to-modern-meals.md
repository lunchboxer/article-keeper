# Food for thought: How ancient diets compare to modern meals

How different was ancient food from the meals we eat today? Very different! Let's take a tasty time trip to see how eating has changed over time.

Long ago during the Stone Age, there were no fridges or grocery shops! Stone Age families hunted animals, fished, and picked plants to eat. Their food was meat from deer, fish from rivers, nuts, fruits, veggies, and eggs. With no farms, they moved around a lot to find food.

Cooking was easy. Meat and fish got roasted on fires or dried in the sun. Grains like wheat got crushed and mixed with water to make porridge or flatbread. No pots, pans or utensils! They ate with their hands.

Skipping ahead to Ancient Greece and Rome, people farmed crops and raised animals like chickens, goats and cows. This gave them lots of food. Rich people ate meat, seafood, fruits, veggies, eggs, dairy, nuts, olives, bread, lentils and wine. Poorer folks ate simpler meals of grains, veggies, olive oil and wine.

In the Middle Ages, most people rarely ate fresh meat. Only the rich could buy beef or pork. Peasants ate salty fish and used small bits of meat to flavor stew. They ate dark bread, thick stews called pottage, ale, roots, beans, dairy and eggs. Spices made their food taste better.

In the 1800s, early American home cooking was simple but filling. Settlers grew crops like corn and raised animals. They ate stews, soups, breads and porridge made with cornmeal. Stores allowed more variety as towns grew. Iceboxes kept food cold. New cast iron stoves improved cooking.

Today, grocery stores give us so many food choices! We can eat foods from around the world. Meals have fresh fruits, veggies, grains and proteins. New gadgets like microwaves make cooking quick. Even as food changes, mealtimes with family stay special.

From catching dinner to grabbing groceries, meals look different now! But good food with family and friends will always be in style.
