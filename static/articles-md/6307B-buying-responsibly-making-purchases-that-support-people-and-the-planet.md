# Buying Responsibly - Making purchases that support people and the planet

When we buy things, we can choose companies that are fair to workers and the environment. Here are some tips for being a responsible shopper!

## Buy Local

Buying local means buying stuff made near where you live. You could buy fruits and veggies from a farmerâ€™s market instead of a big store. Local farmers often use fewer chemicals. And less transportation is needed to get the food to you. This helps the planet! It also supports businesses in your community.

## Buy Organic

Organic foods are grown without man-made pesticides or fertilizers that can harm the environment. Animals that produce organic meat, eggs, and dairy aren't given medicines or growth hormones either. Organic farming is better for the planet and our health! Look for the USDA Organic seal when shopping.

## Buy Fair Trade

Fair trade means workers who made the products are paid a fair amount under good conditions. Many products are made cheaply by underpaying workers. Fair trade makes sure farmers and factory workers around the world are treated well. Items that are fair trade certified include coffee, chocolate, crafts, and clothing.

## Buy Eco-Friendly

Eco-friendly products are made in a way that doesn't harm the environment. This might mean using recycled materials, less packaging, or manufacturing processes that reduce waste. For example, cloth shopping bags are reusable and eco-friendly compared to disposable plastic bags. Cleaning supplies made from plants are often eco-friendly too.

## Buy Cruelty-Free

Cruelty-free products are not tested on animals. Many beauty and cleaning products are still tested on animals, which can hurt them. Choose cruelty-free brands if you want to avoid supporting animal testing. Look for the Leaping Bunny logo or check company websites for their animal testing policies.

Making responsible purchases is easy! Look at labels, do research, and ask questions about where products come from. Every shopping choice makes a difference. By buying local, organic, fair trade, eco-friendly, and cruelty-free products, you can help build a healthier, fairer world.
