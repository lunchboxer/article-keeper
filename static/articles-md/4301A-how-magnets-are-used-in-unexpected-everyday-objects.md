# How magnets are used in unexpected everyday objects

Get ready to have your mind blown! Magnets are hiding in more places than you'd expect. From toys to trains, magnets make our lives easier and more fun in ways you may not realize.

Let's start with one of the most popular magnet uses - refrigerator magnets! Those colorful little shapes do more than just look cute. The magnet on the back lets you stick your amazing drawings and important reminders right on the fridge. Magnets hold those papers in place without any tape or pins. Pretty handy!

Here's a kitchen appliance you wouldn't expect to find magnets in - the microwave! Behind the control panel, there are powerful magnets called magnetrons. When the microwave is on, these magnets spin around and create microwaves that heat your food. No magnets = no yummy reheated leftovers!

Magnets aren't just for indoor fun. Roller coasters use something called magnetic braking to help control the speed of the carts. Sensors along the tracks can detect where the cart is and turn magnets on or off to slow the cart down at just the right time. This makes the ride safer while still keeping the thrills!

Now let's talk about some musical magnets. Electric guitars have magnetic pickups under the strings. When the metal strings vibrate, the magnetic pickups turn those vibrations into electrical signals. Those signals get amplified to produce rocking guitar sounds! Keyboards also have magnets under the keys to detect when a key is pressed.

Magnets are also essential when you're traveling. Magnetized ink is used to store information on MetroCards that lets you swipe your way onto subways and buses. Magnets in compasses point you north so you can figure out which direction to walk. And magnets are key to keeping trains levitated above tracks in maglev (magnetic levitation) train systems.

Who knew magnets could help athletes too? Inside speed and distance trackers, tiny magnets spin around when you move. This triggers signals that get converted into your pace and step count. So magnets are helping you train for your next 5K!

From the hospital to outer space, magnets have changed the game. MRI machines use powerful magnets along with radio waves to see inside the human body in incredible detail, helping doctors diagnose issues. And the spacecraft Voyager 1 contains a magnetometer to study magnetic fields as it travels billions of miles through space!

As you can see, magnets are more amazing and important than you might have realized before. Keep an eye out for the incredible invisible forces of magnets at work all around you!
