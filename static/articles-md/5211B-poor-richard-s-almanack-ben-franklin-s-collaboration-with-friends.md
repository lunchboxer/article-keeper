# Poor Richard's Almanack: Ben Franklin's Collaboration with Friends

Benjamin Franklin is one of the most famous people in American history. He helped write the Declaration of Independence. He also published his own book called Poor Richard's Almanack.

An almanac is a book with lots of information to help people. Franklin's almanack had weather reports, recipes, poems, sayings, and more. It became very popular! But Benjamin Franklin did not write the almanack all by himself. His friends helped him.

Franklin started publishing the almanack in 1732. He used the fake name "Richard Saunders." The almanack had funny sayings like "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."

Franklin asked his friends to write stories, math problems, and games for the almanack. His friend Thomas Godfrey made puzzles and games. His friend Joseph Breintnall pretended to be "Busy Body" and wrote funny letters.

Franklin's smart friends helped too. They calculated when the sun and moon would rise and set. And when eclipses would happen. Farmers used this information to plant their crops. Sailors used it to plan their travels.

Poor Richard's Almanack was published every year for 25 years! Bookstores in Philadelphia sold over 10,000 copies each year. People loved the sayings, stories, and useful facts.

Some of Franklin's sayings are still used today. Phrases like "haste makes waste" come from Poor Richard's Almanack. All of Franklin's friends helped make the almanack a big success. It taught and entertained people for generations.
