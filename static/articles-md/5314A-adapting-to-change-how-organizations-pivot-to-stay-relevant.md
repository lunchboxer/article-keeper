# Adapting to Change: How Organizations Pivot to Stay Relevant

Have you ever wondered how big companies are able to change and adapt over many years? It's not easy! Successful organizations must be ready to change plans and shift focus quickly when needed. This ability to "pivot" is key to staying relevant.

Let's look at some famous pivots throughout history. Back in the 1920s, Nokia was actually a paper mill company. They made paper products like toilet paper! But in the 1960s, they pivoted to focus more on tech products like radios and TVs.

In the 1990s, Nokia started making mobile phones and became the top mobile phone maker in the world. But when iPhone was launched in 2007, Nokia didn't adapt quickly enough. They stuck with old-style "dumb phones" too long. They lost market share to Apple and Samsung's smartphones.

Another example is YouTube. Did you know that YouTube originally started in 2005 as a video dating website? But there was not much interest in that idea. The founders soon realized that users wanted an easy way to share all kinds of videos. So YouTube pivoted to become a video sharing platform open to anyone. This change allowed YouTube to grow rapidly. Today it is one of the biggest websites in the world!

Some other major pivots include Twitter, which started as a podcasting platform, and Instagram, which was originally a location-based social app called Burbn. Both companies saw opportunities to shift their focus. These changes made them super successful!

But changing direction is risky. There are lots of famous failures too. In the 2000s, Blockbuster dominated video rental. But when Netflix started mail-order DVD rentals, Blockbuster did not take the threat seriously. They failed to pivot to a new digital strategy. Blockbuster ended up going out of business due to competition from Netflix and other streaming services.

Changing too quickly can also be a problem. In 2000 AOL and Time Warner merged to create a massive media company worth over $350 billion, the biggest merger ever at the time! But clashing company cultures made it hard to execute their vision. Just a few years later, they suffered huge losses and split apart.

Adapting requires companies to stay on top of new technologies and trends. They must experiment with different ideas and business models to see what works. Moving fast and taking risks is necessary. But they should do so thoughtfully, without overreacting.

Organizations that can master the balancing act of pivoting at the right moments have the best chance of thriving over decades. But it isn't easy! Next time you hear about a hot new startup disrupting an industry, remember that staying power takes flexibility and the ability to adapt.
