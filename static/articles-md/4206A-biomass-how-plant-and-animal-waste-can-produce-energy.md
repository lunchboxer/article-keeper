# Biomass: How plant and animal waste can produce energy

What if I told you that garbage could be used to power your house? It may sound strange, but energy can actually be produced from plant and animal waste, known as "biomass." Biomass includes things like wood chips, corn stalks, and even animal poop. Believe it or not, biomass can be converted into useful energy sources like electricity, transportation fuels, and heat for our homes and buildings.

Most biomass comes from plants. As plants grow, they absorb energy from the sun. When the plants die or we cut them down, that stored solar energy remains inside them. For example, the trunks and branches of trees contain lots of energy that can be released by burning the wood. The same goes for corn stalks left over after harvesting corn, or sugarcane fibers left over after extracting the sugary juice.

Animal waste and landfill garbage also contain biomass that can be converted into energy. Cow poop and food scraps in landfills slowly decay, producing methane gas that can be captured and used as fuel. Yuck! But it's true.

There are a few different ways to convert biomass into usable energy:

Direct burning - Biomass can be burned directly for heat or to boil water to run steam turbines that generate electricity. For example, burning wood chips or pellets to produce heat for buildings, or burning sugarcane waste to produce electricity.

Biofuels - Biomass like corn, sugarcane, or vegetable oils can be processed into liquid biofuels like ethanol to replace gasoline for transportation. Dynamite!

Landfill gas capture - Pipes are installed in landfills to collect methane gas released as trash decays. This gas can then be used as fuel for generating electricity or powering vehicles. Double whammy!

Converting biomass into energy has lots of benefits. First, it reduces the amount of waste going into landfills. It also provides a renewable fuel source, since we can always grow more plants and crops to produce biomass. And unlike fossil fuels like oil and coal, burning biomass is carbon neutral - it doesn't add extra carbon dioxide to the air because the plants already absorbed that carbon as they grew. Pretty cool!

However, some challenges exist too. It takes land, water and other resources to grow the biomass. There can also be air pollution from burning it directly. And not all areas have abundant biomass sources available. But researchers are working to develop cleaner and more efficient conversion technologies.

The future looks bright for biomass as a renewable energy source. With improvements in how we capture landfill gas, process biofuels, and utilize waste products, biomass could provide an increasing share of the world's energy needs in an eco-friendly way. So next time you mow the lawn or take out the trash, think about the potential energy going to waste. We're surrounded by untapped biomass resources - our job is learning how to use them wisely!

## Glossary

- biofuels - Fuels like ethanol or biodiesel that are made from plant and animal materials.
- biomass - Organic matter from plants and animals, like wood, waste, algae or crops, that can be used as an energy source.
- carbon neutral - When carbon dioxide released from burning a fuel is balanced by carbon dioxide absorbed from the air during plant growth. No net addition of carbon to the atmosphere.
- methane - A clean burning gaseous fuel produced in landfills as waste decays. Can be captured and used as an energy source.
- steam turbine - A device that uses steam to spin blades and generate electricity.
