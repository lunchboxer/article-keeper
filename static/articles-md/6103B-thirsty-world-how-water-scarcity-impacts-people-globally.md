# Thirsty World - How water scarcity impacts people globally

Water is one of the most important things that all people and animals need to live. But many people around the world do not have enough clean water. This is called water scarcity. About 2.2 billion people do not have water that is safe to drink. That's almost 1 out of 3 people on Earth!

There are a few reasons why some places don't have a lot of clean water. First, in some areas there just isn't a lot of freshwater around. Most of the water on Earth is in the oceans. Only about 3% of the world's water is freshwater that we can drink. Some places also have water that is dirty or polluted from trash, chemicals, or waste. Dirty water can make people very sick if they use it.

Another reason is climate change. Climate change is causing more droughts in some parts of the world. Droughts happen when there is way less rain than normal for a long time. With less rain, there is less freshwater for people to use. Climate change is also causing giant sheets of ice called glaciers to melt away. When glaciers melt, the freshwater they provide disappears too.

One country with extreme water scarcity is Yemen. Yemen is located in the Middle East on the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen has been fighting a civil war since 2014. This war has made it even harder for people to get clean water. About 20 million people in Yemen do not have enough clean, safe water. Because of this, Yemen is also having the worst cholera outbreak ever in modern times. Cholera is a terrible disease that causes bad diarrhea. It spreads through dirty water. Since 2016, cholera has made over 2 million people sick in Yemen.

In Cape Town, South Africa, a long drought almost left 4 million people with no water. From 2015-2017, the area got very little rain for 3 years in a row. The government warned that "Day Zero" was coming. That was the day when water would no longer flow from taps. People waited for hours to get water from springs. Schools and businesses had to close. Finally in 2018, the drought ended. Cape Town barely avoided completely running out of freshwater.

People dealing with water scarcity have to travel far to collect water. This keeps kids out of school. It also keeps parents from working. Gross water makes people sick and unable to live healthy lives. Clean water gives people the chance to go to school, be healthy, and grow businesses.

What can be done to help provide clean water to those in need? Drilling wells, building dams, and systems to catch rainwater can help. Protecting water and keeping it free of pollution is key. Most of all, the world must work together to solve the global water crisis. With smart solutions and hard work, we can make clean water available so everyone on Earth can thrive.
