# The role of electromagnets in industry

Electromagnets are super cool! They are magnets that can be turned on and off using electricity. Unlike normal magnets, electromagnets can pick up and drop metal objects just by flipping a switch. This makes them really useful in factories and other industrial settings.

Electromagnets were discovered way back in 1825 by a British scientist named William Sturgeon. He made the first electromagnet by coiling wire around an iron core. When he ran electricity through the wire, the iron core became magnetic! Sturgeon's discovery showed that you could control magnetism using electricity.

Since Sturgeon's breakthrough nearly 200 years ago, engineers have found tons of uses for electromagnets. One of the biggest is lifting and moving heavy metal objects like cars in junkyards and scrap metal yards. The electromagnet on a crane can pick up a car by simply running electricity through the coiled wire. When the operator wants to drop the car, they just turn off the electromagnet. This makes moving piles of metal super easy!

Electromagnets are also used in junkyards and recycling plants to separate different types of metals. The electromagnet can pick up just the steel cans from a pile of trash by turning on the magnet. When the operator wants to grab the aluminum cans, they reduce the magnet's power so it releases the steel and grabs the aluminum instead. Being able to sort metal types quickly is important for recycling.

Another industrial use for electromagnets is in car factories. Electromagnets move sheets of steel from place to place on the assembly line and position car parts for welding by robots. Using an electromagnet for this is way better than having a person try to lift heavy car parts into place all day long! Electromagnets can do the same repetitive tasks nonstop without getting tired.

One of the most powerful electromagnets ever created was built by scientists at a national laboratory in New Mexico. This huge magnet can lift an entire car into the air! Special electromagnets are also used inside MRI machines, which are big machines that take pictures inside the human body using magnets and radio waves. Pretty crazy!

As you can see, electromagnets are superhero helpers in many industries. Their ability to selectively pick up and release metal objects makes tasks like lifting, moving, and sorting metals a breeze. The power and uses of electromagnets will only increase as technology advances. Just imagine what future electromagnets will be able to do!
