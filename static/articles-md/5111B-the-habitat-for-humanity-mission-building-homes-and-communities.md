# The Habitat for Humanity Mission: Building Homes and Communities

What if you didn't have a home? Some kids don't! Their families struggle every day to find a nice place to live. Habitat for Humanity is a group that helps build houses for families who need them.

Habitat for Humanity's mission is to show God's love. They do this by having people work together. They build houses, help communities, and give hope.

A man named Millard Fuller started Habitat in 1976. He and his wife Linda wanted to make houses that low-income families could pay for. They asked volunteers to help build simple, decent houses. Families could buy them with an affordable mortgage. A mortgage is a loan from the bank to buy a house.

The first Habitat house was built in 1976 in Americus, Georgia. Since then, Habitat has built over 800,000 houses around the world! The group uses donated money and materials. Volunteers help build and fix up the houses.

When a family is picked to get a Habitat home, they help build it. This is called "sweat equity." It means they work hard to build their own house. They also help with other Habitat houses. This makes homeowners feel good. They feel proud of their home.

Building houses is one part of Habitat's mission. They also build communities! Habitat brings all kinds of people together. They work as a team to reach a goal. Building a Habitat house takes lots of people. There are sponsors, volunteers, homeowners and partner families. Building community is as important as building homes.

Habitat gives a "hand up" to families who want to improve their housing. Decent, affordable shelter provides stability. Stability means a steady, secure situation. Shelter helps parents work and kids go to school.

Owning a Habitat home is a dream come true. It gives families strength, safety and joy. Home provides a foundation to build life on. Just ask the Lecaros family in Chile! Thanks to Habitat, the parents have jobs. The kids go to school. They have a happy home.

We can all help the Habitat mission. Volunteering, donating, spreading the word - we build homes, communities and hope. With decent housing, families gain dignity, safety and hope for the future. Imagine if everyone had a nice place to call home!
