In ancient Egypt, one of the most famous pharaohs was Tutankhamun. Known as "King Tut", he became pharaoh when he was only 9 years old! King Tut is legendary for the treasures found in his tomb after he died at age 19. Archeologists discovered amazing golden artifacts, including King Tut's famous gold funeral mask. King Tut helped restore the traditional Egyptian beliefs during his reign after a period when a different religion was forced on people.

In China, Qin Shi Huang was the first emperor to unite the lands that make up modern China into a single empire. Before Qin Shi Huang, China was divided into many separate kingdoms that were constantly at war with each other. Qin Shi Huang stopped the fighting between kingdoms and ruled over a unified China. He was known for his many ambitious projects, like building massive palaces and the Great Wall of China. According to legend, he was buried with a life-sized terracotta army to guard him in the afterlife!

Hammurabi was a famous and influential king who ruled the Babylonian Empire almost 4,000 years ago. He is legendary for creating one of the oldest written law codes in the world. Hammurabi's Code established clear rules and punishments for crimes like theft and murder. The code said that punishment should fit the crime. Hammurabi had these laws carved into stone pillars so that everyone could see them. This was important because it helped ensure justice and order across his empire.

In India, Chandragupta Maurya founded the powerful Maurya Empire in 321 BCE. He was the first person to unify nearly all of India under one rule. Chandragupta built a large army and defeated many enemy kingdoms. His empire had a strict law and order, which helped trade, farming, and arts to flourish. As a follower of Jainism, he gave up his throne and became an ascetic monk in his later years.
