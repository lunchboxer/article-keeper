# Oil Spills - The impacts of environmental disasters in our oceans

Oil spills are not fun for sea animals. Spills happen when ships carrying oil crash and leak oil into the water. Or when equipment that drills for oil under the ocean breaks and oil leaks out. The oil spreads across the top of the water, looking like a big stain.

When birds land on the oil, it sticks to their feathers. It stops them from flying or keeping warm. Seals, sea otters, and other sea mammals swim in the oil and get it stuck in their fur. Trying to lick the oil off makes the animals very sick. The oil is toxic.

Fish and shells get oily too. People won't want to buy and eat fish or shells covered in oily gunk. This means less money for fishermen after a spill.

Over time the oil spill spreads into smaller spots. The sun and waves help break up the oil. But it takes many, many years for the ocean to get clean again.

Scientists and volunteers work hard to save animals after a spill. They clean the oil off of birds and mammals to help them survive. Stopping spills before they happen is crucial. New ships with double hulls and other safety tools help prevent spills. But accidents still take place.

Oil spills teach us to be very careful with oil and things that can hurt nature. How we use the oceans affects ocean health. Hopefully by learning about spills, we can stop them and take better care of sea creatures.
