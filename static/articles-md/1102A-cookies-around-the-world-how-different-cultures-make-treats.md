In the United States, chocolate chip cookies are very popular. The chocolate chips add little bursts of chocolatey flavor. Peanut butter cookies are also loved in the U.S. These cookies have a smooth, nutty taste from peanut butter. Oatmeal raisin cookies are made with rolled oats, raisins, and spices like cinnamon. The oats give the cookies a hearty, chewy texture.

Mexico has a famous cookie called polvorones. These crumbly, buttery cookies use lots of cinnamon. The name "polvorones" means "little powders" in Spanish, describing how the cookies crumble in your mouth. Mexico also enjoys wedding cookies, which are rolled in powdered sugar after baking.

Italy has several cookie traditions. A classic is pizzelle, which means "little pizzas" in Italian. Pizzelle are thin, crispy waffle cookies made in a special iron. Italians also make rainbow cookies called brutti ma buoni. These have a meringue-like, chewy texture and are dipped in chocolate.

In France, madeleines are a delicate cookie baked in a shell-shaped mold. Their light, cakey texture goes perfectly with tea or coffee. France is also known for palmiers, which are flaky, sugary cookies made with puff pastry dough.

Austria has creative cookie designs, like springerle. These get imprinted with wooden molds before baking, making picture designs. Lebkuchen are Austria's traditional gingerbread cookies, often enjoyed at Christmas markets.

The Netherlands is famous for stroopwafels, made from two thin wafers stuck together with sticky caramel syrup. These pair great with coffee or hot chocolate. Another Dutch cookie is kruidnoten, little balls flavored with spices like cinnamon, ginger, and cardamom.

In India, laddoos are round, sweet balls made from flour, ghee, and sugar. They come in all colors and flavors, like pistachio, coconut, or saffron. Chaklis are savory Indian cookies flavored with ajwain and cumin seeds. They have a satisfying crunch.
