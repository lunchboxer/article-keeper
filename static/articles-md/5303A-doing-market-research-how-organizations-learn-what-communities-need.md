# Doing Market Research: How Organizations Learn What Communities Need

Have you ever wondered how companies know what kinds of products and services to offer? How do they find out what people need or want? The answer is **market research**!

Market research is the process companies use to figure out what products or services they should sell. They do this by studying communities and learning about people's needs, interests, and opinions.

There are two main types of market research: **primary research** and **secondary research**. Primary research involves going directly to the source to get new information. Companies might conduct surveys, hold focus groups, or interview people one-on-one. Secondary research uses information that already exists, like census data, sales records, or articles published in magazines or newspapers.

Once companies have collected the research, they analyze the data to spot **trends** and patterns. If many people say they need household cleaning products that are better for the environment, the company might decide to make new "green" cleaners. Or if sales records show that a certain product is no longer selling well, the company may stop selling it.

Some of the biggest companies have entire departments focused on market research. At toy companies like Hasbro, market researchers study toy trends and kids' interests. They visit schools, hold focus groups, and analyze toy sales records. All this helps them know which new toys and games they should develop.

Other companies hire outside market research firms to gather information. These firms are skilled at surveys, focus groups, interviews, and data analysis. No matter who does it, the goal is the same - to really understand customers' needs.

Market research takes time and money, but it pays off. When companies do their homework, they are much more likely to create products people want. Their customers end up happier, and the companies earn bigger profits. It's a "win-win" situation for everyone!
