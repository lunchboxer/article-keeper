# Work and play: Jobs and hobbies long ago and today

Have you ever wondered what jobs and hobbies were like long ago? Things sure have changed over the years! Let's take a look at how work and play were different in the past.

Back in the olden days, most jobs had to do with farming. There were no big factories or office buildings. People lived and worked on farms or in small villages. Men did a lot of hard physical work like plowing fields, chopping wood, hunting and fishing. Women cooked meals, made clothes, cleaned, and cared for children. Older kids had chores like feeding animals, carrying water, and helping in the fields.

For fun, families told stories, sang songs, and played simple games like jacks or catch. With no TV or video games, play time usually meant being outdoors and using your imagination. Kids played tag, hopscotch, marbles, or jumped rope. They climbed trees, splashed in creeks, and made up new games. Toys were simple too - things like carved wooden animals, corn husk dolls, or sticks and hoops.

Today, there are many more kinds of jobs to choose from. While some people still work in agriculture, many have jobs in places like offices, hospitals, schools, stores, and factories. Modern machinery and technology help workers be more productive. Some common jobs include teacher, nurse, office worker, salesperson, mechanic, and construction worker.

In their spare time, people today have lots of fun hobbies to enjoy. Popular hobbies include sports like soccer, basketball, and swimming. Others enjoy creative hobbies like drawing, photography, or playing music. Reading, cooking, gardening, and collecting things like stamps or coins are also common pastimes. With computers and video games, indoor play is more exciting than ever. But many still love playing outside, going on bike rides or playing games of tag and hide-and-seek just like kids did long ago.

While some things change over time, the joy of play and meaningful work stays the same. Whether climbing trees, building model planes, writing stories, or inventing new games, hobbies and jobs help us express who we are. As long as we follow our interests and talents, we can find purpose in work and pleasure in play.
