# Work and play: Jobs and hobbies long ago and today

How were jobs and fun different long ago? Let's see how work and play have changed over time.

Long ago, most jobs were on farms. There were no big factories or offices. People lived and worked in small towns or on farms. Men did hard work like plowing fields, chopping wood, hunting and fishing. Women cooked food, sewed clothes, cleaned the house, and took care of kids. Older kids had chores like feeding animals, getting water, and helping in the fields.

For fun, families told stories, sang songs, and played easy games like jacks or catch. With no TV or video games, play time was outside using your imagination. Kids played tag, hopscotch, marbles, or jumped rope. They climbed trees, played in creeks, and made up new games. Toys were simple too - like carved wooden animals, corn husk dolls, or sticks and hoops.

Now, there are more kinds of jobs to choose from. While some people still work on farms, many work in offices, hospitals, schools, stores, and factories. New machines and technology help workers get more done. Some common jobs now are teacher, nurse, office worker, salesperson, mechanic, and construction worker.

People today have lots of fun hobbies too. Popular hobbies are sports like soccer, basketball, and swimming. Others like creative hobbies such as drawing, taking photos, or playing music. Reading books, cooking, gardening, and collecting things like stamps or coins are common too. Indoor play with computers and video games is exciting. But many still love playing outside, biking, playing tag and hide-and-seek like long ago.

While some things change over time, the joy of play and good work stays the same. Whether climbing trees, building models, writing stories, or making up new games, hobbies and jobs help us be who we are. If we follow what we like to do, we can find purpose in work and fun in play.
