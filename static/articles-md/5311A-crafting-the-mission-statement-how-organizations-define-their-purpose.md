# Crafting the Mission Statement: How Organizations Define Their Purpose

Have you ever wondered how big companies like Nike or Disney came up with their mission statements? A mission statement is a short sentence or two that explains what an organization aims to accomplish. It's like a roadmap that guides all the work a company does.

When leaders of an organization sit down to write their mission statement, they think hard about what makes their company special. What do they hope to achieve over the next 5, 10, or even 50 years? A good mission statement inspires employees, attracts customers, and sets the tone for the future.

For example, Disney's mission statement is "to make people happy." That simple phrase has shaped Disney into one of the most beloved companies in the world. From Mickey Mouse cartoons to theme parks like Disneyland, everything Disney does is focused on bringing joy to families.

Or take Southwest Airlines, known for friendly service and low fares. Their mission is "dedication to the highest quality of customer service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit." When employees join Southwest, they understand the company's commitment to putting customers first.

Of course, writing a mission statement is easier said than done! It takes time to distill what your company is all about into just a few meaningful words. Leaders often go through many rounds of brainstorming and wordsmithing to get it just right.

Here are some tips for crafting a memorable mission statement:

- Keep it short, usually 2-3 sentences or less. You want it to be clear and easy to remember.

- Get input from employees at all levels. They know the organization best.

- Focus on your company's aspirations more than day-to-day work. Think big picture!

- Communicate what makes your company unique. What sets you apart from competitors?

- Inspire pride and passion. Employees should connect emotionally with the mission.

- Avoid generic or overused phrases that could apply to any company. Be distinctive!

The next time you crack open a Coke or shop at Target, think about the mission statements driving those brands. It takes vision and care to summarize an entire organization in just a few words. Mission statements may be short, but they have a big impact.
