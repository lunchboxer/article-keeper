# Nature's Bounty: How Fruits and Vegetables Led Families West

In the mid-1800s, thousands of families packed up their belongings and headed west in covered wagons on a long and difficult journey. They were hoping to start new lives and settle the western frontier. What led so many people to risk it all and move west? Believe it or not, fruits and vegetables were a big reason!

In the early 1800s, most fruits and vegetables in America came from Europe. Imported fruits like oranges and lemons were very expensive. The only veggies many people ate were potatoes, cabbage, and onions. Farmers mostly grew grain crops like wheat and corn.

Then in the 1820s, farmers started planting orchards with apple and peach trees. They also grew more vegetable crops like tomatoes, sweet corn, and squash. With this bounty of delicious fruits and veggies, America no longer had to rely on imports from Europe.

As fruit orchards and vegetable farms spread west, word also spread about the amazing fertility of the land. Pioneers were enticed by stories of rich, fertile soil that could grow bountiful crops. After long winters surviving on plain fare like potatoes and bread, the thought of feasting on juicy peaches and vine-ripened tomatoes sounded like paradise.

Moving west was still very risky, though. The journey westward covered over 2,000 miles, crossing mountains and deserts. Many pioneers didn't survive the harsh trip. Those who did make it found a tough life building homes and farms.

But the fruit orchards and vegetable farms they planted thrived in the fertile frontier land. Some pioneers wrote home about growing pumpkins as big as washtubs! With hard work, the settlers achieved their dream of a prosperous new life sustained by the fruits of their labor and nature's bounty.

The pioneers' letters, books, and diaries told vivid stories of the abundant crops on the frontier. Their tales inspired more settlers to head west in hopes of staking their own claim and feeding their families from the fertile land. The availability of fresh fruits and veggies on the frontier played a key role in the great migration west.

So next time you crunch into a juicy apple or pluck a ripe tomato off the vine, think of the pioneers who traveled west for the chance to grow such flavorful fruits and vegetables. Although they faced many hardships, pioneers like the Donner party made their way westward lured by nature's bounty!
