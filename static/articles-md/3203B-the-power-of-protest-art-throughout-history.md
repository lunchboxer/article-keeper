# The Power of Protest Art Throughout History

For a very long time, artists have used their creativity to stand up for what they think is right. From way back in ancient times until today, people have made powerful protest art to help create change.

In the mid-1800s, a group of artists called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. They started painting in a brand new style. They wanted to protest the too fancy and unrealistic art that was popular then. Instead of scenes from myths, they painted real people dressed like in medieval times. Their special and beautiful paintings started an art revolution.

In the 1960s in America, popular protest posters were made to speak out against racism and the Vietnam War. Bold graphics and slogans told people to fight for peace and equal rights. These posters got the public excited and advertised protest rallies. Modern protest posters and street art today keep this tradition of using art to spark change.

In ancient Rome, graffiti was scratched into walls and monuments to protest and say what they thought. Graffiti artists now follow this old, old tradition. Their colorful and eye-catching street art sends a message and decorates public places.

Protest songs also have a long history. In the early 1900s, African American blues singers sang sad songs about their poor treatment and hard lives. This soulful music gave people hope. In the 1960s, protest songs about the Vietnam War, poverty, and civil rights pushed for political action. Today, rap songs carry on the tradition of speaking out against unfairness through music.

For hundreds of years, art has given a voice to people struggling for justice. From the Pre-Raphaelites to modern street artists, creative rebels have used their talents to tell the world what needs to change. Protest art gets people excited to fight for what's right.
