# The Art of Animation: Bringing Cartoons to Life

Have you ever wondered how cartoons and movies like Frozen and Finding Nemo are made? The process of making animation is called animation. Animators are the people who make animation. They use different tricks to draw, move, and bring characters to life on screen. Let's look behind the scenes at how animators make cartoons!

One of the first tricks animators used was called cel animation. They drew every single picture by hand onto clear sheets called cels. Then they stacked the cels on top of painted backgrounds. When the cels were filmed together, it looked like the characters were moving! Early cartoons like Gertie the Dinosaur used cels. Later movies like Snow White also used cels. Cel animation isn't used as much today. But it helped make classics like Cinderella.

Next animators started using computers in the 1970s and 80s. With computer animation, they build characters on the computer. Then they can move them around to pose them before adding color and details. Movies like Toy Story showed what could be done with computer animation. Live action movies also use it to make cool creatures, explosions, and other effects.

Whether they use cels or computers, animators use tricks to make movements more real. Squash and stretch makes actions look bouncy. Anticipation prepares the viewer, like someone leaning back before throwing. Arcs make movements, like throwing a ball, feel natural. Timing impacts the emotion - a fast run feels happier than a slow walk.

Today, animators mix computer animation with hand-drawn looks. SpongeBob SquarePants mixes digital coloring with hand-drawn effects. Stop motion, moving things by hand, is still used in movies like Chicken Run. No matter how they animate, cartoons let us tell fun imaginary stories. Next time you watch a cartoon, look for the creative art that brings it to life!
