# Strange sources of renewable energy

Where does energy come from? You might think of coal or wind power. But scientists are looking at some very weird energy sources!

One odd idea is to get energy from pee! It sounds gross, but it could work. Pee has nutrients that help bacteria grow. The bacteria can make a small LED light turn on. Someday bathrooms may light up using pee power!

Another strange energy source is dance floors. When people dance, their feet make vibrations on special pads under the floor. The pads turn those vibrations into a tiny bit of power. One famous dance club in London uses this to power its whole building! Every night when people dance, they make green power.

Sweaty clothes could also make energy. Scientists are making clothes that collect sweat from your armpits when you exercise. The clothes have fibers that turn the sweat into a little bit of electricity. Don't throw out those stinky gym clothes yet! They might help power the future.

Rotten fruit could give us renewable power too. Fruit lets off traces of electricity as it rots. Scientists hope to trap this energy in "bacteria batteries". Farmers could use old fruit scraps to get free power.

Some researchers are looking at seashells and lobster shells for power. The hard shells have minerals that make electricity when squeezed. A company is testing ways to use leftover shells from seafood restaurants. Those crab cakes could end up lighting someone's home!

So next time you feel out of energy, remember our planet has some odd sources to tap into. With smart innovation, your dancing, sweaty socks, and even bathroom breaks could help power the world!
