# Wild and wonderful animals: Ancient vs. modern relationships with animals

People and animals have had special relationships for thousands of years. In ancient times, people depended on animals for food, clothing, transportation, and even companionship. Today, most people no longer rely on animals for survival, but animals are still very important to us.

In ancient times, animals were seen as helpers and partners. Horses carried people from place to place. Dogs helped with hunting and protecting homes. Cows and goats provided milk, eggs, and meat. Sheep, rabbits, and even silkworms gave people materials to make clothing. People and animals worked side-by-side every day.

People also formed close bonds with animals as pets and companions. Ancient Egyptians mummified cats when they died, showing how much they cared for them. Cave paintings depict people hunting with dogs at their sides. Animals have been by our side throughout human history.

Nowadays, most people in developed countries do not need to depend on animals for food or materials. Advanced farming practices and synthetic materials like polyester have taken the place of many animal products.

While animals are still raised for food, it is on a much larger, industrial scale that aims for efficiency rather than partnership. Most people do not rely on horses for transportation or cows for milk from their own farms.

However, animals are still treasured for recreation, sports, service, and companionship. Today, equestrian sports like polo and horse racing remain popular. Service animals help people with disabilities live more independent lives. People keep all kinds of animals as pets, from dogs, cats, and birds to reptiles, spiders, and even sugar gliders!

Zoos and aquariums allow us to connect with amazing wild animals from around the world. We can learn about them and appreciate their beauty without needing to hunt them or use them for labor. Modern technology even allows us to study animals in their natural habitats from great distances.

The human-animal relationship has changed dramatically over thousands of years. As civilizations developed, people relied less on animals for survival. Now animals are partners in sports and service while also serving as beloved pets and entertainers. Our connections have evolved into relationships of admiration, curiosity and friendship. Animals remain a wonderful and meaningful part of human life.
