# Holiday Heroics: Amazing Feats Performed on Special Days

Holidays are times for having fun with family and friends. But some people use holidays to do awesome things! Read this to learn about some wild holiday feats.

On New Year's Eve in 2017, Stig Severinsen from Denmark set a world record! He held his breath under water for 24 whole minutes! That's longer than a TV show. Severinsen trained hard so his body did not need as much air. He relaxed his mind to make his heart beat slower. His cool feat under the water broke the old record by four minutes!

In the USA, the Fourth of July celebrates freedom with fireworks. But Robbie Knievel decided to jump his motorcycle over fireworks in 2015! He went fast and flew over 148 feet of exploding sparklers. The fireworks went boom all around him as he jumped high in the sky. Knievel stuck the landing perfectly to the cheering crowd. His daring jump over fireworks was awesome!

Halloween is a spooky night for costumes. In 2018, magician David Blaine dressed up as a balloon version of himself! Over Arizona, he climbed a cable from a real balloon up to his pretend balloon costume. He spent over an hour "floating" thousands of feet above the ground, pretending to be a balloon. His silly act amazed the people who saw him.

Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday with candles and songs. In 2005, Chris McDougall ran the longest race ever on Hanukkah! He ran for 24 hours around a school track. That's like running from Philly to New York City without any breaks! McDougall ran all night and day, showing holiday feats come in many forms.

On Easter, a big egg hunt happens on the White House lawn. In 1999, athlete GiGi Fernandez found all the eggs in a fun way. She bounced a tennis ball on a racket with an egg on top over 200 times without dropping it! She batted the egg perfectly in an awesome holiday trick.  

Holidays are perfect for trying new things! What amazing holiday feats can you think up? Holidays are a good excuse to go after big goals and dreams. With creativity and effort, you could end up in the record books too!
