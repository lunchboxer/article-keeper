Art can be made from all sorts of strange and surprising materials! Some creative artists use junk and trash to make their artwork. Using recycled materials helps give new life to old, worn out stuff. The artists featured here transform junk into awesome artworks that are fun to look at.

One artist who makes art from junk is Nick Cave. He uses all kinds of random objects like buttons, fabric scraps, twigs, and more to create wild costumed sculptures. His "Soundsuits" cover the whole body from head to toe. Dancers wear the Soundsuits and perform in them. The Soundsuits make noise when the dancer moves around. Some Looks like wild aliens from outer space!

Another junk artist is Leo Sewell. He uses discarded objects like old toys, tools, and kitchen gadgets to make amazing animal sculptures. A life-size elephant sculpture is made from shovels, forks, and broken umbrellas. A giant octopus sculpture is made from old wrenches and other rusty metal pieces. The sculptures look so real, you forget they're made of junk!

Michelle Reader is a junk artist who makes beautiful mosaic artworks using discarded objects. She collects old jewelry, game pieces, buttons, and more. Then she arranges and glues the objects onto wood panels in colorful swirling patterns. The mosaics sparkle and shine in an exciting way.

Many junk artists get their materials from flea markets, garage sales, and thrift shops. Or they collect cast-off stuff from local businesses, like pieces of scrap metal. Some artists find useful items just sitting on the street waiting to be picked up! One person's useless junk can become an amazing work of art in the hands of a creative junk artist.

Next time you see an old cracked bowl, rusty tool, or faded doll, don't be quick to throw it away. With a little imagination, it could become part of an exciting junk sculpture, collage, or mosaic artwork! Art made from recycled materials helps us look at trash in a whole new way.
