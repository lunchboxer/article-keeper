# Social Entrepreneurs - Businesses seeking solutions through commerce

What do you want to be when you grow up? A police officer? A singer? A basketball player? How about a social entrepreneur? Social entrepreneurs are people who start companies to make the world better. They see problems and try to fix them by selling goods or services.

Social entrepreneurs care about more than just money. They also want to help people and the planet. For example, Blake Mycoskie started a company called TOMS Shoes. For every pair of shoes he sold, he gave away a free pair to a child in need. He has given over 60 million pairs of shoes to kids!

Some social entrepreneurs try to protect the environment. Lauren Gropper started a company called Repurpose. It makes bowls, plates, and forks from recycled materials. This stops waste and keeps plastic out of landfills and the ocean.

Other social entrepreneurs work to solve big health issues. Kate Cheney began a company called NovaBone to help people with broken bones heal faster. The company uses science to make special bone implants in their labs.

Some social entrepreneurs focus on giving jobs to people who need them. Greyston Bakery in New York makes yummy brownies and cookies. But they also give jobs and job training to folks who've had trouble finding work.

As you can see, social entrepreneurs use business as a tool to drive positive change. They come up with smart ideas to earn money and help others at the same time.

Here are some common ways social entrepreneurs give back:

- Donating goods - For each item bought, they give away a similar item to someone in need. TOMS Shoes works this way.

- Hiring people who need opportunities - They make an effort to hire and train people facing challenges finding work. Greyston Bakery does this.

- Using eco-friendly practices - They make products in ways that protect the planet and reduce waste. Repurpose makes recycling cool!

- Reinvesting profits to further their mission - They use their earnings to grow their efforts to help others rather than just make money for investors.

Social entrepreneurs also face challenges. It's not easy to run a successful business while also working towards big social goals. But with hard work and creativity, social entrepreneurs will keep finding new ways to earn money and change lives.

Maybe you'll become a social entrepreneur someday too! The next time you buy lemonade from a lemonade stand, think about how cool it is to buy something that also helps others! We all can make the world better.
