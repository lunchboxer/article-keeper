# Wild and Wacky Electric Inventions Through History

People have been inventing electrical gadgets for hundreds of years. Early electric inventions were pretty simple, like batteries and light bulbs. But as technology improved, inventors came up with all kinds of wild and wacky electric gadgets! Here are some of the strangest ones.

Back in the 1700s, scientists were just starting to study electricity. One scientist named Luigi Galvani discovered that he could make a dead frog's legs twitch by zapping them with electricity! This became known as "galvanism." Galvani's nephew, Giovanni Aldini, took galvanism even further. In 1803, he zapped a dead criminal's body with electricity. The body jerked around as if it was alive!

Soon inventors tried using electricity to heal people who were still alive. The first electric massagers and belts came out in the late 1800s. People thought electricity could cure all kinds of diseases. One electric corset claimed to help women lose weight. A 1911 newspaper ad said it let women "look thin while getting thin."

Other wild electric health gadgets included the vibrating barber chair and the electric hair brush. Sitting in a vibrating barber chair was supposed to give you a healthy massage. The electric hair brush claimed to make your hair shinier and fuller. But most of these gadgets probably did more harm than good!

In the 1920s, inventors got even more creative with electricity. One of the wackiest inventions was the teledactyl. It was like an early version of virtual reality. Users put their fingers into electric rings. When they moved their fingers, robot hands copied the movements up to a mile away. The teledactyl never really caught on. But it paved the way for remote-controlled technology.

Another 1920s electric gadget was the necromicon. This wild invention was supposed to use electricity to talk with the dead. People who lost loved ones would ask the necromicon questions. They believed an electric current allowed spirits of the dead to give answers. Of course, the necromicon was just a scam that cheated people out of money. But that didn't stop it from becoming popular after World War I, when many families had lost relatives.

Finally, some of the wackiest electric inventions aimed to replace police officers! In the late 1800s, an electric robot policeman was seen walking the streets of London, England. It could blow a whistle and light up to direct traffic. Meanwhile, a U.S. inventor created "electric eels" that would give criminals an electric shock. He hoped his electric eels would replace real police dogs. Fortunately, neither of those inventions actually caught on!

It just goes to show that electricity has powered human creativity for centuries. Even strange and failed inventions like vibrating chairs and robot cops show how endlessly inventive we can be. Who knows - maybe someone today is dreaming up a wild new electric gadget that will seem perfectly normal to people 100 years from now!
