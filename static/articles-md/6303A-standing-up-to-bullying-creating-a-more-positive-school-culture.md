# Standing Up to Bullying - Creating a more positive school culture

No one should feel scared or alone at school. But sometimes kids get bullied. Bullying happens when someone is mean to another person over and over again. The bully wants to make the other person feel bad. Some bullies hit or kick. But words can hurt too. When someone calls you names or spreads rumors, that’s bullying too.

Bullying is never ok. If you see bullying, don’t join in. Speak up and tell the bully to stop. Get a teacher or parent to help. Remind the bully that everyone deserves to feel safe at school.

Some kids get bullied because they look or act different. Others may get bullied because of their race, religion, or who they like. But it’s important to accept people even if they’re not the same as you. Just because someone is different doesn’t mean it’s ok to be mean.

There are lots of ways students and teachers can work together to stop bullying. Post kind words on classroom doors. Eat lunch with someone who is alone. Include kids in games on the playground. Smile and say hi to classmates in the hall. Small acts of kindness help everyone feel welcome.

Many schools now have bullying prevention programs. These programs teach important skills. Students learn to care for one another. They also learn how to safely stand up to bullying. Teachers help students understand bullying is unacceptable. The whole school works together to stop bullying before it starts.

Students can also help prevent bullying by reporting incidents right away. Tell a teacher, principal, or parent if you see bullying. Keep telling until someone helps make it stop. Students should never feel like tattling. Speaking up shows you care about safety. It helps create a school where everyone can learn without fear.

No student deserves to be bullied. But the problem won’t go away by itself. We all have to work together to stop bullying. Teachers, parents, and students should treat each other with respect. They should speak out against hurtful teasing and call it what it is - bullying. Small acts of courage make schools safer and happier for all. With a little care and teamwork, we can stop bullying for good!
