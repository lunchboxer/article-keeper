# Boycotts - Using purchasing power to protest injustice

Have you ever wished you could speak up about something unfair? Many people feel that way. One way groups can protest injustice is through boycotts.

A boycott is when people stop buying from certain businesses or using certain products. They do this to push the company to change whatever the group is upset about.

Boycotts have been around for a very long time. Hundreds of years ago, American settlers boycotted British goods to protest high taxes. In the 1950s and 60s, African Americans boycotted segregated buses in Alabama. More recently, people boycotted companies that test products on animals.

Boycotts work because they can hurt a company's profits and reputation. When enough customers stop buying, the company has to listen. They don't want to lose money or look bad.

Boycotts can hurt workers at those companies too. So boycotters try not to harm regular workers. The goal is to get the company to change, not cost people's jobs.

Some famous boycotts were led by well-known leaders. In India, Mahatma Gandhi told people to stop buying British cloth and make their own. In America, Martin Luther King Jr. organized bus boycotts in the 1950s.

But anyone can join or start a boycott. The internet makes it easy to tell people about unfair practices. Sites like Twitter and Facebook help protesters recruit people near and far.

Experts say boycotts should focus clearly on one problem. Having a specific goal helps, like getting a company to use fair trade suppliers. Reasonable solutions also make it easier for the company to respond positively.

Of course, boycotts are just one way to make change. They work best with other peaceful actions like letter campaigns, petitions, and protests. The goal should be starting a conversation, not just punishing companies.

Boycotts may not always get the exact changes wanted. But they give regular people a peaceful way to challenge powerful companies and organizations. That's why boycotts continue to be an important way to work for justice.
