# Super Silly Doodles: How to Draw Funny Faces

Do you like to doodle and draw? Drawing funny faces is a super silly way to be creative and make your friends laugh! In this article, you'll learn some easy tips and tricks for creating goofy faces that look hilarious.

First, let's talk about the basic face shape. When drawing a silly face, start with a big circle or oval for the head. Add a smaller circle or oval below that for the chin. Next, draw two circles or ovals on the top half of the head for eyes. Make sure to leave room to add more details later.

Now for the fun part - adding crazy hair! Hair can make your characters look extra wacky. Try spikes, loops, zigzags, or even shapes like stars and hearts. Color it in with wild colors like neon green, purple, or rainbow! The crazier the hair, the funnier the face will look.

Moving on to the eyes, this is where you can get really creative! Instead of plain old circles, try stars, hearts, lightning bolts, or squares. You can add lots of little shapes inside the eyes too. Dots, swirls, and squiggles make the eyes look excited and energetic. Don't forget the eyebrows - arrows, zigzags, and spikes are silly brow shapes.

The nose can be any fun shape you can imagine. Triangles, squares, stars, and circles work nicely. For an extra goofy touch, add dots, stripes, or plaid patterns to the nose. You can also give your character an animal nose like a piggy snout.

Now it's time for the mouth. Big open smiles with lots of teeth showing look hilarious. Try pointy vampire teeth or square robot teeth for extra grins. Stick out a tongue or add a mustache below the nose. Be creative with the shape and size of the mouth too.

With the basic features in place, you can accessorize and add other details. Silly face drawings often include things like glasses, hats, ribbons, necklaces, or face paint. Get creative with patterns, shapes, and colors. Add flowers, startbursts, polka dots, stripes, or anything else that makes you smile!

Once you're happy with your silly face, consider adding a funny caption. Write the character's name, what they're thinking, or what they might say. Speech bubbles and thought bubbles are great for this. Get punny or outrageous with your words and phrases.

As you can see, drawing silly faces is all about imagination and fun. Start with basic shapes, thencustomize them by adding wild colors, zany details, and goofy accessories. Let your creativity run free! With a bit of practice, you'll be doodling hilarious characters in no time. Now get out your art supplies and start crafting some super silly faces!
