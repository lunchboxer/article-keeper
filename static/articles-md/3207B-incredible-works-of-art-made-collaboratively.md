# Incredible Works of Art Made Collaboratively

Making art by yourself can be fun. But making art together with your friends is even more awesome! Some of the world's coolest art projects were made by teams of artists working together. When creative people join forces, they can make art that's bigger, more exciting, and more complicated than anything one artist could make alone. Let's look at some amazing collaborative art projects that will blow your mind!

A long time ago, the Pope asked the artist Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of a chapel in Italy called the Sistine Chapel. But the ceiling was huge - over 5,000 square feet! That was too big a job for one person. So Michelangelo got a team of talented artists to help him. For 4 years, they stood on tall ladders and painted beautiful religious pictures. They started at one end of the chapel and slowly filled up the whole ceiling with color. When they finished, visitors to the Sistine Chapel were amazed by the fantastic paintings above them.

Another famous art project made by a team is Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. In 1927, a sculptor named Gutzon Borglum began carving the faces of four U.S. presidents - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln - into the side of a mountain. He led 400 skilled workers who used dynamite, jackhammers, and chisels to cut the 60-foot tall stone heads. After 14 years of hard work, Mount Rushmore was done in 1941. Now over 2 million people visit every year to look at this huge work of art!

Sometimes art is made spontaneously by big groups of people. For example, the Before I Die walls in many cities were started by an artist named Candy Chang. She painted abandoned houses with chalkboard paint. At the top she wrote "Before I die I want to..." Anyone walking by could grab chalk and fill in their hopes and dreams. The art project became very popular. Soon there were Before I Die walls popping up all over the world. Anyone can add their wish to these fun and always changing collaborative art pieces.

Large groups can also work together to make art online. Reddit users used their creativity to make pixel art on the website. In 2017, over 1 million Reddit members added tiny colored tiles to giant digital canvases. They formed colorful pictures of characters from video games, TV, movies, and the internet. The Pixel Art app let this big group chat and coordinate their tile placements. The finished mosaic murals showed the power of teamwork.

Some artists have even gotten animals to join in creative projects! In 2015, eleven elephants at the Detroit Zoo painted pictures to raise money to protect elephants in the wild. Their zookeeper covered big canvases with paint. Each elephant held a brush in their trunk to splash on the abstract paintings. The unique artworks were auctioned off to help wild elephants. It was great for art and animals!

As you can see, people can make incredible things when they use their imaginations together. Collaborative art lets creators think big and make their wildest ideas real. Whether it's carving a mountain, covering a chapel ceiling, or painting with elephants, teamwork makes amazing art. Next time you want to make something, get some friends to join you. Let your creativity flow and see what awesome art you can dream up as a group!
