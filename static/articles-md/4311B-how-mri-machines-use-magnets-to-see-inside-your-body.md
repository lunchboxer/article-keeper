# How MRI Machines Use Magnets to See Inside Your Body

Have you ever had to get an MRI? An MRI machine takes special pictures of the inside of your body. It uses strong magnets to do this.

The MRI machine looks like a big donut standing up. You lie down on a bed that slides into the hole of the donut. This moves you into the middle of the machine.

Inside the MRI machine are some of the most powerful magnets in the world! When you are inside, the magnets line up the atoms in your body. Atoms are tiny particles everything is made of.

The machine also sends radio waves at your body. This knocks the atoms out of line again. The atoms then bounce back into place. This sends out energy that the MRI scanner detects.

A computer takes this energy information. It turns it into a clear picture of the inside of your body. Cool!

Since different tissues like bone, muscle, and blood give off different energy signals, the MRI can tell them apart in the pictures. This lets doctors see if parts of your body are healthy or hurt.

Some MRI machines are open on both ends instead of being a closed tube. This helps patients feel less nervous. But the open design needs even stronger magnets to work.

The machine is very loud during the scan. You have to wear ear plugs or headphones. No metal can be near the machine. The magnets are so strong they could pull out metal implants or fillings!

Lying still inside the narrow tube can make people anxious. But the bed slowly slides you into place. This gradual motion helps patients stay calm.

The MRI technician will tell you when the scan starts. You'll hear loud banging as the machine takes the pictures. The technician can see and talk to you through a window. If you need help, just call out!

After the scan, a radiologist will look at the photos. They are specially trained doctors. They can spot injuries, tumors, and other problems.

MRIs show soft tissues, not just hard bones like x-rays. They help doctors diagnose issues like strokes, injuries, MS, and more! The amazing scans even show blood flowing through your veins and arteries. MRIs use magnets in a cool way to see inside you!
