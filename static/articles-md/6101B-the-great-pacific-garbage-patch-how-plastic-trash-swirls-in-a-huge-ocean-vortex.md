# The Great Pacific Garbage Patch - How plastic trash swirls in a huge ocean vortex

There is a giant swirly clump of trash floating in the Pacific Ocean. It's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It's filled with lots of plastic like water bottles, bags, toys and more. Where did it all come from? How did it get there? Let's learn about this yucky plastic soup!

The garbage patch is stuck spinning around in a spot called the North Pacific Gyre. This is a slow swirling current between Hawaii, the US west coast, Japan, and Russia. The spinning traps all kinds of floating trash. Over many years, the trapped garbage piled up into a giant plastic soup.

Most of the trash comes from people littering and garbage blowing away from landfills. Plastic doesn't rot away like banana peels. Instead, the sun breaks it into tiny bits called microplastics. They look like grains of sand.

A sailor named Charles Moore found the patch in 1997. He was shocked to see so much trash floating in the ocean. The patch is now bigger than two whole Texases! Scientists think over 80,000 tons of plastic is floating there. Gross!

The plastic is bad for sea animals. Turtles, seals, fish and birds get tangled up in it. They also eat pieces of plastic thinking it's food. Eating plastic can make animals sick.

People have tried to scoop up the floating plastic trash with boats. But the patch is ginormous. The bits of plastic spread out for hundreds of miles. And they keep breaking into smaller pieces. The best way to help is to use less plastic. Bring reusable bags to stores. Buy things with less packaging. Always recycle plastic when you can. Small changes make a big difference!
