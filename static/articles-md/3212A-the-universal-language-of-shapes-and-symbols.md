# The Universal Language of Shapes and Symbols

Have you ever noticed that some shapes and symbols are used all over the world? Even if people speak different languages, they understand the same basic shapes and pictures. Shapes like circles, squares, triangles and stars are everywhere! Simple pictures like smiley faces, hearts, and arrows are also universal. In fact, shapes and symbols are like a visual language that people from any culture can understand.

Let's start with shapes. The **circle** is one of the most common shapes in nature, art, flags, signs, and more. Circles represent ideas like unity, wholeness, and infinity. The circular shape of the sun and full moon are circle symbols found in cultures across the globe. Many countries' flags feature circles, including Japan, Brazil, and Bangladesh.

The **square** has four equal sides and four 90-degree angles. It is a stable, balanced shape that has been used in architecture and design for thousands of years. Squares represent solidity, perfection, and order. Windows, buildings, picture frames and dice are just a few examples of real-world squares.

Now let's look at some symbolic shapes. The five-pointed **star** is an ancient symbol that appears on flags and artwork worldwide. Stars often represent hope, spirituality, success and dreams. The star and crescent moon is a popular symbol in many Muslim countries. The Star of David is an important symbol in Judaism.

Another universal shape is the **heart** symbol. Stylized heart shapes can look very different, but people recognize them as hearts all over the world. Hearts are supreme symbols of love. Heart designs can be seen on candies, greeting cards, text messages, jewelry, clothing and more.

When it comes to symbols, simple is best. Basic lines and shapes that look like real objects are easy for the brain to understand. For example, stick figures made of lines, circles and triangles have been used to represent people for thousands of years. Arrows made of lines and triangles point the way on signs and diagrams globally.

Some of the most universal symbols are the **smiley** and **frowny** faces. Just two dots and a curve that looks like a smile or frown express happiness and sadness. People have even started holding smartphones sideways to "text" smiley face emojis! No translation needed.

Sharing ideas through shapes and symbols is an international language. Simple circles, squares, hearts and stars speak to cultures across the planet and throughout time. So the next time you see shapes and symbols out and about, think about how they connect us all!
