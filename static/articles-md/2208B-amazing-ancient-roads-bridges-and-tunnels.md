# Amazing Ancient Roads, Bridges and Tunnels

A long time ago, before cars and planes, people still needed ways to travel around and move things from place to place. Some of the old roads, bridges and tunnels that they built are still standing today! Here are some really neat old transportation routes you can even visit.

## The Silk Road

The Silk Road wasn't really one road. It was a bunch of paths that connected China to the Mediterranean Sea. People used it to trade stuff for over 1,500 years! That's from about 130 BCE to 1453 CE. Silk was a big item carried along the Silk Road from China. The routes went through India, Asia, Africa, and Europe too. Traders brought things like spices, gems, glass, and more. Ideas, religions, languages, and sicknesses spread on the Silk Road as well. You can still see parts of cities, palaces, temples, and walls built along the Silk Road.

## Appian Way

The Appian Way was one of the first and most important Roman roads. It connected Rome to the port city of Brindisi in southern Italy. The Appian Way was started in 312 BCE by Roman leader Appius Claudius Caecus. Some parts of the road still have the original material! It's about 350 miles long. There are sections people can walk on today. The road was wide enough for two carriages. It had a drain system, curbs, and stepping stones in case it flooded. Mile markers showed each Roman mile. There were also inns, temples, and tombs along the way.

## Pont du Gard Aqueduct

Aqueducts are bridges that carry water long distances. The ancient Romans built aqueducts to bring water to cities and towns. The Pont du Gard aqueduct in France is one of the best Roman aqueducts left. It was built around 19 BCE. The bridge part has three stacked levels with 35 arches total. It was part of a 30 mile system to move water. It's made of stone blocks without any cement or mortar. The Pont du Gard is 160 ft tall. It has a channel over 3 ft wide for water. It looks like a car bridge, but it only ever carried water!

## Anji Bridge

The Anji Bridge is the oldest open-spandrel stone arch bridge in the world. It was built in China during the Sui Dynasty around the year 605 CE. The bridge goes over the Xiaohe River. It has 37.5 meters across with 21 arches. The biggest arch is in the middle and is 9 meters wide. This design helps the bridge not get ruined by flooding. Even though it's over 1,400 years old, the Anji Bridge still stands and gets used today. 30,000 vehicles drive over it each day!

## Hezekiah's Tunnel

About 700 BCE, King Hezekiah of Judah ordered a tunnel to be dug under the City of David in Jerusalem. It made water from the Gihon Spring go to the Pool of Siloam inside the city walls. This kept the spring water protected if the city was attacked. The tunnel through solid rock is 533 meters long. In some places, you can walk through. In others you have to bend over. The tunnel is S-shaped with carved niches for oil lamps. You can walk through Hezekiah's Tunnel today and even wade through the water at the end.

## Gordion Tunnel

The ancient Phrygians lived in what’s now central Turkey. In the 8th century BCE, they dug a tunnel under a mountain by their capital city Gordion. It was probably to move water for irrigation. The tunnel is about 330 meters long and 1.7 to 2.5 meters tall. It's a little V-shape from digging both ways. There are 82 inscriptions inside with early Phrygian writing and pictures of animals and plants. The Gordion Tunnel shows amazing old engineering skills.

From paved roads in Rome to irrigation tunnels in Turkey, people long ago built incredible things to solve transportation problems. Many are still engineering wonders today! Next time you go over a bridge or get on the highway, think about how we still use those ancient builders’ smart ideas!
