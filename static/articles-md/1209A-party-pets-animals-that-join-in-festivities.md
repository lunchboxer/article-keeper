# Party Pets: Animals that Join in Festivities

Hey kids! Have you ever wondered which animals like to party and join in the fun when there’s a celebration going on? Well you’re in luck, because in this article we’re going to talk about some of the wildest party animals around!

First up we have the parrot. These colorful birds love to get their groove on when there’s music playing. They’ll dance and bob their heads, sometimes even singing along in their squawky parrot voices. Some parrots have even been taught specific dance moves by their owners!

Next is the dog. Man's best friend loves a good celebration whether it's a birthday, holiday, or just a fun get together. Dogs get excited by all the happy energy and will run around wanting to play and be part of the action. They especially love birthday parties with fun party hats and getting treats from all the guests!

Then we have cats. Our feline friends tend to be more selective in the parties they attend, but some cats do enjoy a good shindig. They like exploring all the new smells and hiding under tables to bat at people's legs as they walk by. And when the guests are gone, they'll happily help clean up by licking any dropped ice cream or cake off the floor.

Many farm animals also get in on party fun. Goats will snatch food off the table and nibble on clothes. Chickens will mill about hoping for dropped scraps. And don't forget about pigs - they love a good party and will run around oinking excitedly with party hats on!

So next time you're planning a birthday bash or fun get together, think about inviting some of these party loving pets. They'll bring lots of energy and silly antics to liven up any celebration! Just be ready to clean up afterward!
