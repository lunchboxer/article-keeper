# Early experiments with electricity: Sparks and shocks

Have you ever gotten a shock from touching a doorknob after walking across a carpet? That's static electricity! Static electricity has been around forever, but it took people a long time to learn about it and figure out how to use electricity on purpose.

Back in ancient Greece around 600 BC, philosophers like Thales of Miletus noticed that if you rubbed amber with cloth, it would attract bits of straw. This phenomenon was called ‘electricity’ after the Greek word for amber, ‘elektron’. But electricity remained a curiosity for centuries.

In the 1600s, scientists started experimenting with static electricity in a serious way. In England, physician William Gilbert rubbed many substances together and ranked them by how much static electricity they produced. He realized that insulation helps build up charges.

Otto von Guericke in Germany took this further. In 1660, he invented an early electric generator called the ‘electrostatic machine’. It used a spinning ball of sulfur and produced sparks over 2 feet long! Guericke held parties where he dazzled guests by making sparks fly between their nose and hand.

Benjamin Franklin entered the scene in 1749. Through his famous kite experiment, he showed that lightning was a form of electricity. This led him to invent the lightning rod to protect buildings. Franklin also created terms like ‘battery’, ‘conductor’, and ‘electrician’ that we still use today.

In the late 1700s, Italian scientist Luigi Galvani discovered ‘animal electricity’ by making frog legs twitch with metal probes. Soon after, Alessandro Volta built the first true battery, called the voltaic pile. This let scientists produce steady electric current for the first time, instead of just brief sparks and shocks.

In 1800, Humphry Davy used the voltaic pile to pass current through thin strips of metal. This created the first electric arc light. It was so bright it hurt people's eyes! Arc lighting would later be used in lighthouses and public spaces.

By the 1830s, Michael Faraday had turned electricity into a new branch of science. He introduced the concept of electromagnetic fields. Among many inventions, Faraday created the first electric motor and the first dynamo, or electric generator.

Faraday’s work kickstarted the age of electricity. Over decades, scientists and engineers transformed electricity from a laboratory curiosity into a revolutionary new power source that would change the world. Early pioneers like Franklin and Galvani could never have imagined that!

## Glossary

 insulate: prevent the loss of heat or electricity from (something) by lining or surrounding it with material that does not allow heat or electricity to pass through easily

- phenomenon: a fact or situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or explanation is in question
- static electricity: a build up of electrical charge on the surface of an object, typically caused by contact and separation of materials
- conductor: a material which allows electricity or heat to pass along it or through it easily
- dynamo: a machine for converting mechanical energy into electricity using electromagnetic induction
