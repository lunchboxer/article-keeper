# Incredible Works of Art Made Collaboratively

Making art can be a blast, but making art with friends makes it even more awesome! Some of the world's most impressive art projects were created by teams of artists working together. When creative minds join forces, they can make artwork that's bigger, cooler, and more complex than anything a single artist could do alone. Let's check out some totally stellar collaborative art projects that will blow your mind!

Back in the 1500s, the Pope asked Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Italy. But painting a ceiling that's over 5,000 square feet was too big a job for one person! So Michelangelo led a team of talented artists to help out. For 4 years, they stood on tall scaffolds and painted beautiful biblical scenes. They started at one end of the chapel and gradually filled the whole ceiling with color. When they finished, visitors to the Sistine Chapel were stunned by the magnificent paintings overhead.

Another famous collaborative art project is Mount Rushmore in South Dakota's Black Hills. In 1927, sculptor Gutzon Borglum began carving the faces of four U.S. presidents - George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln - into the granite mountainside. He led 400 skilled workers who used dynamite, jackhammers, and chisels to sculpt the 60-foot tall stone heads. After 14 years of hard work, Mount Rushmore was completed in 1941. Now over 2 million people visit every year to admire this monumental work of art!

Sometimes art is created spontaneously by crowds of people. For example, the Before I Die walls found in many cities were started by an artist named Candy Chang. She covered an abandoned house in New Orleans with chalkboard paint and stenciled "Before I die I want to..." at the top. Passersby grabbed chalk and filled in the blanks with their hopes and dreams. The public art project became a huge hit, and soon there were Before I Die walls popping up globally. Anyone can add their own bucket list wish to these ever-changing collaborative art pieces.

Large groups can also work together on art online. Reddit users pooled their creativity to make fun pixel art on the social platform. In 2017, over 1 million Redditors contributed tiny colored tiles to enormous digital canvases. They formed vibrant pictures of their favorite characters from video games, TV shows, movies, and internet memes. The Pixel Art app let this hive mind of artists chat and coordinate their tile placements. The completed mosaic murals showcased the power of teamwork.

Some artists have even involved animals in joint creative projects! In 2015, eleven elephants at the Detroit Zoo painted pictures to raise money for elephant conservation. Their zookeeper covered large canvases with paint and gave each elephant a brush to hold in their trunk. The elephants had a blast splattering the abstract paintings with colorful designs. The unique artworks were auctioned off to support the elephants' wild counterparts. It was a win-win for art and animals!

As you can see, people can make amazing things when they put their imaginations together. Collaborative art allows creators to think big and make their wildest ideas a reality. Whether it's sculpting a mountain, covering a chapel ceiling, or splashing paint with elephants, teamwork brings art to life in incredible ways. Next time you feel like making something, grab some friends to join in. Then let your creative juices flow and see what awesome art you can dream up as a group!
