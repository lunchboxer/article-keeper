# Team Sports Through the Ages: How Collaboration Created Favorite Games

Team sports are fun to play and watch! But where did they come from? Many sports we love started a long time ago. Let's learn about how some famous team games were invented.

One very old sport is soccer. People started kicking balls into goals over 2,000 years ago! They played soccer in ancient China, Greece, Rome and Egypt. Modern soccer started in England in the 1800s. Teams from different towns made up their own rules.

The first official rules for the soccer we know were written down in 1863. Soccer was called "the people's game" because everyone could play, no matter if you were rich or poor. Today, soccer is played by more people than any other sport in the world!

Basketball is a newer game than soccer. A teacher named James Naismith invented basketball in 1891. At the time, he was teaching indoor sports in winter. It was too cold to play outside!

Naismith put up two peach baskets on opposite walls of the gym. The goal was to throw a soccer ball into the baskets. With its fast action and easy rules, the new game caught on quick. Soon real hoops and balls replaced the baskets. And basketball became very popular.

Of course, we have to talk about football too. American football came from rugby and soccer. The first college football game was in 1869 between Princeton and Rutgers.

The football we know really took shape in the 1880s. A player and coach named Walter Camp changed the rules. He had 11 players on each team instead of over 50! And he created the line of scrimmage. In a few decades, football became America's favorite sport to watch.

What do all these team sports share? They show how playing together can create traditions. Sports like soccer, basketball and football seem like they were here forever. But it took teams working together to turn them into the games we love! What new traditions will you make with your teammates? When you work as a team, anything is possible!
