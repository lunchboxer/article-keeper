# Glory of Greece: Touring ancient Greek ruins and artifacts

Let's imagine traveling way back in time over 2,500 years ago to ancient Greece! What would it have been like to walk around the same streets and buildings as people like Socrates, Plato, and Alexander the Great? We can't really time travel, but we can visit many of the awesome ancient Greek ruins that still exist. Get ready to use your imagination as we explore some famous sites of ancient Greece!

One famous ruin is the Acropolis in the city of Athens. The Acropolis is an old fort with temples on top of a tall hill overlooking Athens. The most famous temple there is the Parthenon, with its huge columns and fancy carvings. Walking up the steps of the Acropolis feels like going back in time as you look at the amazing old ruins and picture what they were like thousands of years ago.

Near the Acropolis is another cool site called the Ancient Agora! This was like an old Greek downtown with shops, temples, and a meeting place. Here smart people like Socrates and Plato would give speeches and share ideas. The ruins feel magical, almost like you can still hear their voices.

There are ruins all over Greece. On the island of Delos you can check out the remains of a whole ancient Greek town! Walk around old temple ruins, a theater, streets with houses, and the famous Terrace of the Lions. This was also the legendary birthplace of the twin gods Apollo and Artemis.

No tour of Greek ruins is complete without seeing the site of the very first Olympic Games - Olympia! The Olympics started here in 776 BC and were held every four years. Explore the old stadium and temples where athletes competed long ago. You can picture the crowds cheering on their favorite sports over 2,000 years ago!

In addition to ruins, many ancient Greek artifacts still exist today. These objects give us a glimpse of ancient Greek art and culture. Some famous artifacts are statues like the Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace. Others include painted vases with scenes of myths, gods, and everyday life. Mosaics, jewelry, coins, and bronze statues are also on display.

Visiting the ruins and artifacts of ancient Greece is an awesome way to connect with the past. As you walk around sites where legendary people once stood and look at objects they made and used, it's like history comes to life! So get ready for a super fun adventure back in time to ancient Greece!
