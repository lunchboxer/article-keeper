# Charities - Organizations tackling global issues

There are lots of problems in the world today. Many people are poor or hungry. The water and air are dirty in some places too. Luckily, there are special groups that try to make the world better! These groups are called charities. Charities raise money to help people and the planet. Let's learn about some cool charities!

One big problem is that some people don't have clean water. It's hard to stay healthy if your water is yucky! A charity called charity: water helps people get clean drinking water. They build wells and systems to pump and filter the water. They have helped over 10 million people get clean water so far. Wow!

Another issue is hunger. Some people don't get enough healthy food to eat. That makes it hard for kids to grow up strong and learn in school. Heifer International gives farm animals to families who need them. Chickens lay eggs, cows make milk, and llamas can carry heavy things. These animals give food and products to sell so families can make money. Heifer has helped over 33 million families!

The environment matters too! We all share the land, air, and water. Planting trees makes the air cleaner and gives animals homes. The Arbor Day Foundation plants millions of trees in forests every year. They also protect rainforests from being cut down. This saves all the birds, bugs, and animals that live there. So far, they have planted over 350 million trees!

There are lots of other great charities too. St. Jude's Children's Hospital helps kids with cancer, even if their families can't pay. Doctors Without Borders sends doctors to places with disease and disasters. The Nature Conservancy buys land to make protected nature areas.

Charities need donations from kind people who want to help. They hold fundraisers where people can give money. You can also donate online on their websites. Even a small donation can make a difference when charities work together to do good!

We all share this wonderful planet Earth. It's important we care for each other and the environment too. Charities let regular people like you and me help out. If we work together and stay hopeful, think of all the good we can do!
