# Strange and Surprising Art Made from Junk

Some artists make art from odd, used things! They use junk and trash to create fun sculptures, collages, and mosaics. Using old stuff in new ways is called recycled art. This kind of art gives junk a new life! Let's look at what some creative recycled artists make.

One recycled artist is Nick Cave. He makes weird costumed sculptures called Soundsuits. Soundsuits cover the whole body. Dancers wear Soundsuits to perform in. Nick's Soundsuits are made from buttons, fabric scraps, twigs, and other objects. The suits make noise when the dancer moves! Some look like crazy aliens from outer space.

Another recycled artist is Leo Sewell. He makes animal sculptures from old toys, tools, and kitchen stuff. He made a huge elephant from shovels, forks, and broken umbrellas. He also made a giant octopus from rusty metal pieces and wrenches. His sculptures look very real, even though they are made of trash!

Michelle Reader makes mosaic art from discarded things like jewelry, game pieces, and buttons. She glues the objects onto wood in colorful swirly designs. Her mosaics shine and sparkle in an exciting way.

Where do recycled artists find their materials? Many go to flea markets, garage sales, and thrift shops. Some collect leftover stuff from businesses, like scrap metal pieces. They may even pick up useful junk sitting on the street! What seems like useless trash can become amazing recycled art.

So don't throw away that cracked bowl or faded toy just yet! With creativity, it could become part of a fun recycled sculpture or collage. Art made from junk helps us see trash in a whole new way!
