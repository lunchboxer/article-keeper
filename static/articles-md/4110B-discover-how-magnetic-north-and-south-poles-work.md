# Discover how magnetic north and south poles work

Have you ever used a compass? A compass has a red needle that points north. But that north is not the real North Pole! The compass points to something called magnetic north. Let's learn why compass needles point there instead of the real North Pole.

The Earth acts like a big magnet. It has a magnetic north pole and a magnetic south pole. These magnetic poles are near the real geographic North and South Poles, but not in exactly the same spots.

The magnetic poles are where Earth's magnetic force is strongest. This invisible magnetic force flows between the north and south magnetic poles.

Compasses work by lining up with Earth's magnetic force. One end of the compass needle points to magnetic north, and the other end points to magnetic south. This lets compasses show you which way is north, even if you can't see stars or landmarks.

Magnetic north is not the same place as the real North Pole or true north. That's because the magnetic poles move around over time. Right now, magnetic north is moving over 40 miles each year across the Arctic Ocean!

In fact, many times in history the magnetic poles have even traded places completely! Scientists think this happens because iron deep inside the Earth's core can shift around. When lots of iron lines up in a new way, it makes the magnetic poles move.

The switching of magnetic north and south doesn't really affect our daily lives. But it does matter for navigation. Airplane runways are named based on their direction compared to magnetic north. So when magnetic north moves, those names have to change!

Scientists today use the real North Pole as the official north for maps and sailing. The line between the geographic North and South Poles is called the Prime Meridian. It passes through England and helps us label east and west on maps.

But magnetic north still helps scientists learn about what's deep inside our planet. And knowing where it moves allows compasses to work properly. Pretty cool for a force we can't even see!

Next time you use a compass, think about the magnetic force guiding that red needle around!

## Glossary

- **compass** - A tool with a magnetized needle that points north and south.
- **geographic poles** - The North Pole and South Pole, at the tops and bottom of Earth's axis.
- **magnetic force** - The invisible force created by Earth's magnetic poles. Makes compass needles point north and south.
- **magnetic poles** - Where Earth's magnetic force is strongest, near the geographic poles.
- **Prime Meridian** - The line of longitude at 0Â° that passes through England and helps label east/west.
