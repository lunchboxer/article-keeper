# Gift-Giving Greats: Presents that Made History

Do you like giving and getting gifts? People have done it for a super long time! Some gifts turned out to be so special they changed things forever. Keep reading to learn about some of the best gifts ever given.

Way back in ancient Egypt, around 1279 BC, the ruler of Egypt was named Pharaoh Ramses II. He was given 21 baby lions as a gift by a ruler in Africa! That must have been so exciting! Ramses II loved showing off his pet lions. He even took some lions with him into battle! 

Moving ahead to the 1500s AD, there was a Queen named Elizabeth I who ruled England. One day a man named Sir Walter Raleigh did something very nice for the Queen. As she was walking down a grassy hill, he took off his fancy coat and put it on the ground so she wouldn't get mud on her feet. What a nice thing to do! The Queen was very happy. After that, she made him part of her royal group at the castle. 

Speaking of royal people, when Prince Albert married Queen Victoria in 1840, he gave her a very unique gift. It was a golden bracelet with an emerald snake head! Victoria liked reptiles a lot and wore the snake bracelet all the time. She even had a painting made of herself wearing it. What a cool historical gift!

So far we've talked about royal people getting some crazy gifts. But sometimes gifts are about kindness. In 1869, a man named St. Nicholas wanted to help a poor family who couldn't afford wedding gifts for their daughters. So he secretly threw bags of gold coins into their house on three nights! This inspired the legend of Santa Claus giving gifts on Christmas Eve.

Of course, gifts don't have to be about money. Words can be gifts too! In 1865, President Abraham Lincoln gave a speech called the Gettysburg Address that made slavery against the law. It was short but very powerful. It was a gift of freedom for so many people.

Some gifts help science move forward. In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation gave money to develop penicillin, a medicine that fights infections and helps people get better quickly. Thanks to their gift, penicillin still saves millions of lives each year!

More recently, some amazing gifts have been given too! In 1981, the actress Elizabeth Taylor got a giant diamond necklace from her husband Richard Burton for her 40th birthday. It cost over $1 million but he could afford it since they were Hollywood movie stars. What a sparkly gift!

As you can see, giving gifts has been a big deal throughout history. From pets to jewels to inspiring words, gifts show love, kindness, and appreciation. So next time you give or get a present, think about how it joins this wonderful tradition!
