# Hydro-electric dams: Generating power from water

Have you ever wondered where the electricity comes from when you turn on the lights? A lot of it comes from special power plants called hydro-electric dams. Dams use the energy from flowing water to generate electricity in a super cool way. Keep reading to find out how!

## How a Dam Works

A dam is built on a river by blocking the water flow with a giant wall. This creates a huge reservoir of water behind the dam wall. Near the bottom of the dam wall is the intake. Gravity causes the water to flow down through the intake from the higher reservoir to the lower river on the other side. The flowing water spins giant turbines in the dam which are connected to generators. The generators convert the spinning turbine motion into electrical energy. This electricity then travels through wires to homes, schools, and businesses in the area to power lights, appliances, and devices.

## Benefits of Hydro-electric Dams

Dams are awesome because they provide a steady supply of electricity by capturing the powerful energy in moving water without burning fossil fuels. This makes hydro-electric power cleaner for the environment than power plants that burn coal, oil, or natural gas. Dams are also renewable since they rely on water cycles which replenish river flows. Once a dam is built, it can supply energy for many decades. The reservoirs that dams create offer fun recreational activities like boating, swimming, and fishing too.

## How Dam Construction Impacts Wildlife

Building a new dam and reservoir does affect the natural environment and wildlife in the area. The rising reservoir water can flood forests and fields that are home to animals and plants. Some wildlife may relocate or struggle to adjust to the habitat changes. Fish like salmon can also be blocked from migrating upriver to spawn. However, engineers try to plan dams in ways that minimize environmental impacts. Fish ladders are often built alongside dams which create a path for fish to safely swim upstream.

## Major Dams in the United States

The United States has over 80,000 dams, but only a few hundred are major hydro-electric power dams. The Hoover Dam on the Colorado River is one of the largest dams in the U.S. At 726 feet tall, this curved concrete dam powers over 1 million homes in three states! Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington state is the largest U.S. power producer, supplying electricity to 11 states. Other major dams include the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona and Kentucky Dam bordering Kentucky and Illinois. Dams provide about 7% of total electricity generation in America.

So the next time you turn on the light switch, think about the incredible dams that harness the power of water motion to light up our lives! Dams are engineering marvels that supply clean renewable electricity for our world.
