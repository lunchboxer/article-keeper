# How Emojis are a Modern Form of Communication

Do you use emojis when you text your friends or family? Emojis are little pictures and symbols that show emotions and ideas. They are a fun way to communicate and add color to conversations.

Emojis have become very popular over the last 10 years. In fact, Oxford Dictionary's "Word of the Year" in 2015 was the "Face with Tears of Joy" emoji! This shows just how important emojis have become in modern communication.

## A Short History of Emojis

The first emoji was created in 1999 by a Japanese artist named Shigetaka Kurita. He was working at a mobile phone company and wanted to make text messaging more fun. At first, there were just 172 emojis, mostly faces and symbols.

Emojis became very popular in Japan. By 2010, they were added to the Unicode Standard. This meant emojis could work on mobile phones around the world. Today there are over 3,000 emojis and the number keeps growing!

## Why We Love Emojis

One reason emojis are so popular is that they help add emotional context to text conversations. It's hard to show how you are feeling through plain text. A happy or sad emoji helps you understand the tone.

Emojis also allow you to express ideas and activities quickly. For example, you can send a pizza emoji instead of typing "let's get pizza tonight". Emojis save time and add creativity.

Finally, emojis are fun! Choosing the perfect emoji to show your mood or react to a message feels good. The colorful pictures and cute faces bring joy to conversations.

## Emojis Get Specific

As emojis increased in popularity, they expanded beyond just faces and hand symbols. Today there are emojis for almost anything you can imagine!

There are emojis for different foods like pizza, doughnuts, and spaghetti. Animal emojis like pandas, cats, and whales are very popular. You can even find emojis for activities like sewing, biking, and playing guitar.

New emojis are added each year based on trends and user requests. In 2023, new emojis were added for shaking face, blueberries, and a wifi symbol. Emojis really do reflect modern life!

## Emojis Change How We Communicate

Some people wonder if emojis are changing communication for the worse. Using a picture icon instead of typing a full message seems lazy to some.

However, studies show emojis actually help us communicate better. They add back emotional context that can be lost with short text messages. Emojis also help lighten the mood and bring some fun into conversations.

So don't be afraid to sprinkle some emojis into your next text or email! A well-placed emoji can help your message be positive and clear. Just be careful not to overdo itâ€”a few emojis go a long way!
