# Pollution: The Toll on Our Planet

Pollution is when dirty things get into nature and make it yucky. There are three kinds of pollution that hurt our earth - air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Let's learn about them!

## Air Pollution

Air pollution happens when stinky gases and smoke get into the air. Burning coal and oil makes a lot of air pollution. Big factories and power plants burn coal and oil. Cars and trucks also put pollution in the air from their tailpipes. Even spray cans hurt the air!

Breathing dirty air makes people sick. It can give you asthma and lung problems. It also makes smog so it's hard to see. Acid rain is when rain mixes with pollution. This kills plants and trees.

We can help stop air pollution by walking more instead of riding in cars. Ask your mom and dad to get an electric car that doesn't need gas. Factories should have big fans to blow away the pollution before it comes out.

## Water Pollution

Water pollution happens when yucky stuff gets into lakes, rivers and oceans. Sometimes factories put chemicals in the water - that's very bad! Soap and dirt from washing cars goes into drains and makes the water dirty.

Oil spills from ships make animals like birds and fish very sick. Fertilizer from farms runs into rivers and helps too much algae grow. The algae uses oxygen that fish need to breathe. Garbage and poop in the water spread germs and can close beaches.

We can help stop water pollution by using less fertilizer on lawns. Fix oil leaks in cars. Don't put oil or chemicals down drains. Pick up trash so it doesn't blow into the water. Ask grown ups to use soap without phosphates, which pollute less.

## Land Pollution

Land pollution is when people throw trash on the ground instead of in the garbage. Things like plastic bottles, candy wrappers, and old toys end up all over if we litter. The rain washes this trash into rivers and lakes too. Rotting food and animal poop also pollute the land if not cleaned up.

Landfills are big pits where our garbage goes. They take up lots of space. Rotting garbage also leaks yucky chemicals into the dirt and water under the ground. We can help by making less trash. Recycle bottles and cans. Compost old food instead of throwing it away. Don't use stuff with too much packaging. Put all trash into the right bins, and don't litter!

By learning about pollution, we can keep our earth clean for everyone! Little things, like biking instead of driving in a car, really do help a lot. Our beautiful planet gives us so much. It's our job to take good care of it!

## Glossary

- asthma - A sickness that makes it hard to breathe. Pollution can make asthma worse.

- fertilizer - Chemicals put on plants to help them grow. Too much fertilizer going into rivers and lakes causes problems.

- phosphates - Chemicals found in some soaps and fertilizers. Phosphates getting into water can cause pollution.

- litter - Trash thrown on the ground instead of into a garbage bin. Littering pollutes the land.

- landfill - A big pit where trash and garbage go. Landfills can leak chemicals and pollute land.
