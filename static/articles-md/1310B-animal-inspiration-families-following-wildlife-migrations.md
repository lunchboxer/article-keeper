# Animal Inspiration: Families Following Wildlife Migrations

Animals are amazing! Did you know some animals travel very long distances every year? This is called migration. Migration happens so animals can find better food and weather. Some cool animals that migrate are wildebeests, monarch butterflies, humpback whales, and reindeer called caribou. Keep reading to learn some neat facts about these animal migrations!

In Africa, almost two million wildebeests and hundreds of thousands of zebras and antelopes migrate together in a huge herd every year. This is the Great Migration, the biggest overland migration in the world! The wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes follow the rains across the plains in Africa. When it rains, new grass grows for the animals to eat up. But when the dry season starts, the grass dries up. So the herd must keep moving to find more yummy green grass. Lions, leopards, and hyenas follow the migration too. They try to hunt the wildebeests and zebras for food. The herd must stay alert and keep walking to avoid becoming dinner!

Monarch butterflies are known for their incredible migration each year from Canada and the United States to Mexico. The monarchs fly up to 3,000 miles to reach their winter home in Mexico's forests! No single butterfly makes the whole trip. It takes several generations of monarchs to travel the full distance over a few months. Along the way, the monarchs use the sun and earth's magnetic fields to help guide them south. In early spring, the monarchs that reached Mexico fly north again. This time they lay eggs along the way to make the next generation of butterflies. What excellent navigators!

Humpback whales are giant sea mammals that migrate through the oceans for very long distances. Every winter, humpbacks in Alaska swim over 3,000 miles south to breeding grounds near Hawaii and Mexico. Then when spring starts, the humpbacks make the long swim back north to Alaska to eat in its cold, rich waters. One special group swims the farthest - around 5,000 miles from eastern Australia to feed near Antarctica before heading back north to breed! Along their migration route, humpbacks sing pretty whale songs and breach from the water. Breaching is when the whale jumps mostly out of the water before splashing down. It's an amazing sight!

Caribou are medium-sized deer famous for their giant migrations across the tundra. The tundra is a big, flat, treeless Arctic land. Every spring and fall, hundreds of thousands of caribou migrate in herds across the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. The caribou spend summers eating plants and grasses in the north. But when winter comes, food becomes scarce. So the caribou trek south again to find more food. Some herds' migrations are around 3,000 miles total per year! Caribou migrate in huge numbers to stay safe from predators like wolves and bears. They also work together to clear paths through deep snow. Talk about an epic road trip!

As you can see, animal migrations are really cool! Animals travel across whole continents over land, sea, and air to find food, shelter, and breeding grounds. Their epic journeys connect ecosystems around the world. Migrating animals play an important role in nature, spreading seeds, moving nutrients, controlling insect populations, and becoming food for other creatures. We're so lucky to live on this amazing planet with such remarkable migrating animals!
