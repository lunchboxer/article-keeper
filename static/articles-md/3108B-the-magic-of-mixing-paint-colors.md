# The Magic of Mixing Paint Colors

Grab your paint and brushes for some colorful fun! Painting is super cool. You can make art and new colors by mixing paints. It's like magic!

There are three main colors called primary colors - red, yellow and blue. When you mix two primaries, you get a brand new color called secondary! Mix red and yellow to get orange. Yellow and blue makes green. Blue and red makes purple.

You can keep mixing to get more new shades. Add white to lighten any color. Black makes them darker. Red plus white is pink. Blue and white is light blue. Yellow with a bit of black is yummy chocolate brown - yum!

Trying new color combos is really fun. Real artists use color theory to plan mixes. This helps them get the right shade for their art.

Opposite colors are complementary. They look bright together. Next-door colors on the wheel are analogous. They blend nicely.

The next time you paint, mix your own colors. See if you can match a pretty sunset orange or grassy meadow green. The combos are endless. With practice, you can mix any color you imagine. Who needs plain red or blue when you can paint a rainbow? Let's get blending!
