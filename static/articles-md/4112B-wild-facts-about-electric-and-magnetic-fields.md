# Wild facts about electric and magnetic fields

Are you ready to learn some cool facts about electricity and magnets? They make some pretty amazing invisible fields of energy!

What are electric and magnetic fields? Electric fields are made by electric charges, like the ones that flow through wires. Magnetic fields come from magnets. These fields push and pull on other charges and magnets even though we can't see them.

Here are some fun facts about these invisible fields:

- Your body makes a tiny electric field when your nerves send signals to your muscles. That's how you can move your body!

- Electric eels use cells in their bodies to make strong electric fields that zap anything close by. Zap!

- Earth has a magnetic field that starts deep inside the planet. It protects us from space storms and rays from the Sun. Thanks, Earth!

- When electric and magnetic fields combine, they make electromagnetic fields. Things like radio waves and light are electromagnetic fields. Cool!

- Scientists made the strongest magnetic field ever in a lab. It was over 1 million times stronger than a fridge magnet! It could tear apart a credit card.

- Power plants use giant magnets and coils of wire to make the electricity for our houses. The wire spins inside the magnets.

- Power lines make electric and magnetic fields around them. But don't worry, they are safe at normal levels. Phew!

Wow, electricity and magnets are so interesting! Now you know some shocking facts about their amazing invisible fields. Keep exploring the cool science all around us!
