# Riddle of the ancients: Unexplained mysteries of ancient times

Have you ever wondered about the many mysteries left behind by ancient civilizations? Some of these mysteries have puzzled archaeologists and historians for centuries! Let's explore a few unexplained riddles from the ancient world.

One famous mystery is Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument in England. The huge stones at Stonehenge were placed perfectly upright in a circle. Each stone weighs over 25 tons! No one knows for sure how prehistoric people moved these massive rocks and put them in place. Some theories say they used logs to roll the stones. Others believemagic or alien help was involved! We may never solve the riddle of how Stonehenge was built.

The Pyramids of ancient Egypt are another legendary mystery. The Great Pyramid of Giza is made of over 2 million stone blocks. Each block weighs 2 to 70 tons! How did ancient Egyptians build such enormous pyramids without modern tools and machines? One theory suggests they used ramps and levers to lift the blocks into place. But no one knows for sure. Solving the riddle of the pyramids has challenged experts for centuries.

Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean holds yet another mystery. Hundreds of giant stone statues stand on this remote island. The tallest is over 30 feet high and weighs over 80 tons! How did islanders move these gigantic statues without wheels or machines? Many scholars think they walked the statues slowly across the island using ropes. It's an impressive feat for such a small community! This theory hasn't been proven yet. So the riddle of Easter Island endures.

Some ancient mysteries involve writing. The Voynich manuscript is a medieval book written in a language no one can understand. The 250-page book is full of strange pictures and writing that has never been decoded. Experts think it may be an ancient hoax. But no one has proven who wrote it or what it means! This makes it one of history's most puzzling riddles.

Other mysteries relate to technology. The ancient Greek Antikythera mechanism is an intricate, gear-driven device that tracked astronomical movements. It was built between 150 and 100 BC, nearly 2,000 years before similar clocks were made in medieval times! No one knows exactly what it was used for or how such advanced technology could exist so long ago. This mystery still inspires debate today.

Our ancient past is full of unsolved puzzles that continue to intrigue us. While we may never crack all the codes and riddles, uncovering clues and testing theories is an adventure! There are still many exciting discoveries waiting to be made in the field of archaeology. Solving ancient mysteries helps us better understand our human history.
