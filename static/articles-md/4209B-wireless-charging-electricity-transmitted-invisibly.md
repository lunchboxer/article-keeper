# Wireless charging: Electricity transmitted invisibly

Have you ever had your phone or tablet run out of power? You have to find a charger and plug it in to charge it up. That can be annoying! Some clever engineers have invented a way to charge devices without wires. It’s called wireless charging. Let’s learn how it works!

Wireless charging uses a technology called inductive charging. This allows electricity to be sent between two things that are not plugged in. A wireless charger sends out energy waves you can’t see. When you put a device on the charger, it makes electricity flow in the device. This charges up the battery!

One cool thing is the charger doesn’t have to be plugged into the device. It just needs to be close enough to send the energy waves. It’s like magic - you can charge your phone without wires!

Wireless charging has been around for over 100 years. It was first used to power devices implanted in someone’s body, like a pacemaker. Some electric toothbrushes also charge wirelessly.

Now you can buy charging pads for your phone or tablet. Many new phones can charge wirelessly. The most common wireless standard is called Qi (pronounced “chee”). Any Qi charger will work with a Qi phone.

Some furniture, cars, and public places have wireless charging built-in. For example, you could charge your phone on a table at Starbucks or in a BMW car. IKEA sells lamps and desks with wireless chargers.

One problem today is the device has to be very close or touching the charger. In the future, we may have wireless charging that works from far away! Companies are working on using lasers to send power to devices across a room. Amazing!

Wireless charging is very handy. In a few years, we may not have to plug in devices at all! We’ll just put them on charging surfaces or even charge them from far away. No more cords and plugs to deal with. The next time your phone dies, look for a wireless charger to juice it up!
