# Forward-thinking Leaders - Pioneers of progress throughout history

Hi kids! Let's learn about some cool leaders from the past who came up with big ideas to make the world better. These go-getters weren't afraid to try new things and make changes happen.

Way back in the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy had a huge goal - he wanted to put the first person on the moon! At that time, astronauts had only flown short trips in space. But JFK was determined to go further. He got the whole country excited about space travel and exploring the moon. In 1969, his goal came true when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. JFK's vision made the United States a leader in space.

A long time ago in the 1700s, Benjamin Franklin was known for his inventions and science experiments. He studied electricity and lightning and invented useful things like swim fins and bifocals. Franklin cared about helping his community too. He started the first free public library so everyone could read books. He also organized fire departments to keep Philadelphia safe. His clever ideas made the city better for people.

In 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand for equal rights when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. Back then, there were unfair rules that kept black people separate from whites. Rosa Parks knew this needed to change. Her brave protest led to big changes that made buses desegregated, or open to all races.

Malala Yousafzai is a young but mighty education activist. After being shot for demanding girls' right to go to school in Pakistan, she kept speaking out globally. At only 17, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for working so hard to make education equal everywhere. Malala inspired the United Nations to launch a campaign to help girls worldwide get access to school.

Making progress happens when people stand up for what's right, even if it's difficult. Leaders like JFK, Franklin, Parks, and Malala have paved the way over time with their bold ideas and action. Maybe you'll be a leader who makes a difference too!
