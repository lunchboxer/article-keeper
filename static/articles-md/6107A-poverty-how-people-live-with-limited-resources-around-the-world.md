# Poverty - How People Live with Limited Resources around the World

What does it mean to be poor? Poverty means not having enough money to pay for basic needs like food, housing, and healthcare. Many families around the world live in poverty and struggle to survive. Even though life can be very hard for people living in poverty, they find creative ways to get by and take care of each other.

In some parts of Africa, small village communities work together to grow food and share resources. They build their homes out of mud bricks and straw so they have shelter. Women and girls walk for miles each day to fetch water for their families from the local well. They carry the heavy buckets of water balanced on their heads! Children often do not go to school because their families need them to work at home instead. There are rarely enough jobs or money to go around.

In big cities like Mumbai, India, millions of people live in crowded shantytowns made from scrap metal and plastic tarps. Whole families cram into tiny one-room shacks that provide little protection from monsoon rains. There is no clean running water or electricity. Parents do any work they can find from collecting trash to making bricks. Kids as young as five or six work too. They sell flowers or beg for change instead of attending school.

In rural areas of China, some children stay behind in small country villages while their parents move to cities to find jobs. With no parents around, the children called "left-behind children" must fend for themselves. They cook meals, tend farm animals, and grow vegetables in household gardens to survive. Although life is difficult without their parents, these resilient children find ways to stick together and get by.

No matter where they live in the world, people living in poverty show great resourcefulness. They work incredibly hard every day just to afford food and shelter. Even when they go hungry or get sick, they do not give up hope for a better future.
