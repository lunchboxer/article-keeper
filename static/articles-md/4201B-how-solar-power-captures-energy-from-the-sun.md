# How Solar Power Captures Energy From The Sun

Have you ever noticed those dark shiny panels on some people's rooftops? Those are called solar panels, and they can take energy from the sun and turn it into electricity!

The sun gives off tons of energy called sunlight. This sunlight travels all the way from the sun to Earth in small packets called photons. When photons hit the solar panels, they knock loose electrons from the atoms inside the panels.

Solar panels have a special top layer made of silicon, which is a material that is super good at letting electrons break free when the photons bump into it. As the photons knock electrons loose, it makes the silicon atoms positively charged since they lost electrons.

The now free electrons gather on one side of the panel, while the positive charges gather on the other side. This difference in charges between the two sides creates electricity! Wires attached to the solar panel let us take that electricity and use it to power things like lights in our houses.

For the panels to get the most sunlight, they are pointed right at the sun. Solar panels are organized in long rows tilted toward the south to match the way the sun moves across the sky. This helps them catch as much sunlight as possible during the whole day.

Solar energy is called renewable because the sun will keep on shining for billions of years. We'll never run out of sunlight! Using solar is also better for the environment than burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Burning fossil fuels releases gases that cause pollution and climate change. Solar energy doesnâ€™t cause any pollution.

Right now, solar provides only about 1-2% of all the electricity used in the United States. But more and more people are installing solar panels on their roofs, so solar energy use is increasing very fast. Some experts think solar could give us 30-40% of our electricity by the year 2050! That would really help fight climate change.

Putting solar panels on houses has also gotten much cheaper over the last 10 years. The government gives people discounts and tax breaks on installing solar, so it costs less money up front. And once the panels are up, the sun's light is free! So solar power saves people money and helps the planet.

So the next time you see solar panels, think about the cool technology that lets us use the sun's energy for electricity! Solar power will be very important in lighting up houses and buildings in the future using clean energy from the sun.

## Glossary

- **photons** - Tiny packets of light from the sun that travel to the solar panels.
- **silicon** - A material in solar panels that is good at absorbing sunlight and making electricity.
