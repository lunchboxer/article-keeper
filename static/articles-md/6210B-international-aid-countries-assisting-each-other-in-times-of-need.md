# International Aid - Countries assisting each other in times of need

Have you ever helped out a friend who needed something? Maybe they forgot their lunch at home, and you shared your snack with them. Countries help each other in this way too, especially when there is an emergency somewhere in the world. This is called international aid.

Sometimes big storms called hurricanes hit countries. Or the ground might shake in an earthquake. Many homes get destroyed and people do not have clean water or food. Diseases can spread too. When this happens, countries that were not hurt send help. They send food, medicine, doctors, and other things to the country that needs aid. For example, a huge earthquake hit the country Haiti in 2010. Many countries sent aid to Haiti after the earthquake to help them.

Aid is also sent to very poor countries that need things like food, water, hospitals and schools. Countries in Africa often receive aid from wealthier countries to help their people. Other places like India and Bangladesh get a lot of help too. The aid helps people in these countries get healthcare, education, and more.

Where does aid come from? Most comes from richer countries like the United States, Canada, Japan, France and others. big organizations like the United Nations also send aid. Regular people donate money too.

Sending aid can save lives when emergencies happen. It also helps people in poor countries stay healthier and live better. Leaders should make sure the aid is shared fairly to help as many people as possible. Sadly, sometimes leaders keep the aid instead of giving it to the people. But most aid does reach those in need, and millions are helped.

We all share one Earth. Helping others, even in different countries, is good. International aid shows we care about each other globally.
