# Strange tales of magnetism and electricity in ancient times

Have you ever wondered how people first discovered magnetism and electricity? Even though these forces have always existed, people didn't really understand them until fairly recently. However, there are some strange ancient tales that give us clues about early discoveries of magnetism and electricity. Let's take a look at a few of them!

One of the earliest accounts of magnetism comes from an ancient Greek shepherd named Magnes. As the story goes, Magnes was out watching his sheep one day when the metal tip of his shepherd's staff got stuck to a rock! No matter how hard he pulled, he couldn't separate the staff from the rock. The rock was a lodestone, which contains magnetic iron oxide. The iron tip of Magnes's staff had become magnetized. From then on, people started calling magnetized rocks "lodestones." They also referred to the mysterious attractive force as "magnetism" after the shepherd Magnes.

Ancient peoples didn't just discover magnetism by accident. Some clever thinkers did experiments with lodestones and magnetism. Around the 12th century, a Chinese inventor named Shen Kuo wrote about navigating using a magnetic compass. But even before then, Greek philosophers and Arab scientists were studying magnetic rocks and documenting their properties. They figured out that lodestones naturally align themselves north-to-south, which makes them great compasses!

What about electricity? People have been seeing sparks fly for thousands of years! Ancient writings describe strange electrical phenomenon like lightning and "everburning lamps." According to Egyptian legends, the pharaoh had a glowing light bulb that shined continuously in his tomb without any fire or fuel. Pretty wild, right? Some modern scientists think this "light bulb" was actually an electric arc light powered by a battery. But how did ancient people create batteries and electricity?

One theory points to the "Baghdad batteries" - ancient clay jars found in Iraq. Archeologists think that these jars stored an acidic liquid like vinegar or wine. The jars also contained an iron rod surrounded by a copper cylinder. When filled with an electrolyte solution, these jars could generate a small electric current of around one to two volts! While we don't know for sure how ancient people used these batteries, they show that simple electrochemistry was within reach.

From lodestones to arc lamps, magnetism and electricity have puzzled people for ages. These natural forces seem almost like magic! While ancient civilizations didn't fully grasp the science behind them, they noticed these strange effects and invented clever uses for them. Next time you pick up a magnet or turn on a light, think about how these everyday things once astounded ancient shepherds, pharaohs and scientists!
