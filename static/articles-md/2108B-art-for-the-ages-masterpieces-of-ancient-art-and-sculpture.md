A long time ago, people made beautiful art and statues. This ancient art shows us what life was like back then. It also shows what was important to them. Some of the art is so amazing, we still love looking at it today!

One famous old statue is called Seated Scribe. It was made in Egypt between 2620 BCE and 2500 BCE. That's over 4,500 years ago! The statue shows a man sitting down and holding a scroll. The scroll has writing on it. The man was probably someone who kept records for Egypt's king. This was an important job. The artist made the scribe look focused and wise.

Another great old statue is called Discobolus. It was made in Greece around 460 BCE. This statue shows an athlete getting ready to throw a heavy disc. The sculptor made the athlete look like he is twisting his body and winding up to throw. The statue looks very real, like a photo of the athlete! This lifelike style was brand new in ancient Greece. It inspired sculptors for many years.

Some of the most famous ancient art is cave paintings. In Indonesia, there are cave paintings over 40,000 years old! The paintings show hunts and ceremonies. They give us a glimpse of life tens of thousands of years ago. In Spain, the famous Altamira cave paintings are over 35,000 years old. They show animals like bison, horses, and deer. These cave paintings prove people have been making art since prehistoric times.

Ancient pottery teaches us about daily life long ago. The Greeks painted scenes from everyday life on their pots. Many pots show men exercising in the gymnasium. Others show women weaving cloth. These pottery pictures let us peek into a normal day thousands of years ago in Greece!
