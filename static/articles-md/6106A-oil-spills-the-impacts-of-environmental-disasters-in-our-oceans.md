# Oil Spills - The impacts of environmental disasters in our oceans

Have you ever seen photos of birds covered in black oil? These sad images show what happens when oil spills into the ocean. Oil spills are a major problem for wildlife and the environment. Let's learn about what causes oil spills and how they affect the oceans.

Big oil tankers carry oil across the seas to be used for fuel and plastic. Sometimes these ships crash and leak oil into the water. Other times, oil drilling equipment breaks down and oil leaks from the ocean floor. The oil then spreads out across the surface of the water in a colorful, swirly pattern. From above, it looks like a big oil stain.

All this oil causes big trouble for sea animals. Birds land in the oil and get completely soaked. The oil ruins their feathers so they can't fly or stay warm. Seals, sea otters, and other mammals also swim through the oil. It sticks to their fur and skins. When animals try to clean the oil off by licking it, they get very sick. The oil is poison.

Fish and shellfish get coated in oil too. People won't want to eat seafood that's covered in yucky black oil. Fishermen lose money when they can't sell their catch after a spill.

Over time, the oil spill spreads out and breaks into smaller patches. The sun and waves help break down the oil so it's less harmful. But it takes a very long time - up to decades - for the ocean to recover.

Scientists and volunteers do their best to rescue animals after a spill. They clean off the oil to give birds and mammals a chance to survive. Preventing spills in the first place is important. New technologies like double hull ships and safety valves help. But accidents still happen.

Oil spills teach us that we need to be very careful with things like oil that can cause damage. What we do on land and sea affects the health of the oceans. By understanding spills better, hopefully we can prevent them and take better care of sea animals and the environment.
