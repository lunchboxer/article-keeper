# Fame and infamy: The most legendary leaders of ancient worlds

A long time ago, there were many famous and legendary leaders all over the world. These leaders became famous because they were very wise, strong, and accomplished many great things. Let's learn about some of the most legendary leaders from ancient times!

In the ancient country of Egypt, one of the most famous pharaohs was King Tut. His full name was Tutankhamun, but people call him King Tut for short. He became pharaoh or king when he was only 9 years old! King Tut is legendary because of the amazing treasures found in his tomb after he died at age 19. Archeologists found beautiful golden objects, including King Tut's famous golden funeral mask. King Tut helped bring back the traditional beliefs in Egypt after they were banned for some time.

In ancient China, Qin Shi Huang was the first emperor to unite all the lands that today make up China into one empire. Before Qin Shi Huang, China was split up into many separate kingdoms that were always fighting. Qin Shi Huang stopped the fighting and ruled over all of unified China for the first time. He was known for building many huge palaces and parts of the Great Wall of China. According to legend, he was buried with an army of life-sized statue soldiers to protect him in the afterlife!

Hammurabi was a great and influential king who ruled the Babylonian Empire almost 4,000 years ago. He is legendary because he created one of the oldest written law codes in the world. Hammurabi's Code listed clear rules and punishments for crimes like stealing and murder. The code said the punishment should match the crime. Hammurabi had these laws carved into stone pillars for all to see and obey. This was important because it brought justice and order across his empire.

In India, Chandragupta Maurya started the powerful Maurya Empire in 321 BCE. He was the first person to unite nearly all of India under one ruler. Chandragupta built a huge army and defeated many enemy kingdoms. His empire had strict laws which helped trade, farming, and the arts flourish. As a follower of Jainism, he gave up his throne and became a monk when he was older.

Cleopatra was one of the most famous queens of ancient Egypt. She ruled Egypt for over 20 years and was very smart, charming, and beautiful. She spoke many languages and knew a lot about math, philosophy, and public speaking. Cleopatra made deals with the Roman leaders Julius Caesar and Marc Antony to try to keep control of Egypt. Her tragic love story with Antony has been retold for centuries. Her suicide after Antony lost a battle marked the end of the Pharaohs in Egypt.
