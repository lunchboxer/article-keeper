<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  This site contains a repository of articles for students to read during the
  morning reading period. Students read one nonfiction article every morning
  before other lessons. This 10-20 minute routine is a valuable supplement to
  the regular reading program and a great way to start the school day.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
  Each student is given a printed copy of the article for that day. Students
  read the article quietly at their seats. After completing the article students
  should complete the following 3 tasks:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write two or three things they learned in their Book of Knowledge.</li>
  <li>Find the glossary words in the body of the text and circle them.</li>
  <li>[Optional] complete the reading comprehension questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Students who complete the reading comprehension questions with accuracy of at
  least 80% will get a star added to the morning readers leaderboard.
</p>

<h2>Articles</h2>

<p>Each article is based on a line of inquiry from the current unit.</p>

  the day and the title of the article. Labels for the book of knowledge can be
  printed from

  notebook is ideal.
